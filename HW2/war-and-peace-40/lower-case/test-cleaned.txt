book thirteen : 1812
chapter i
man 's mind can not grasp the causes of events in their <unk> , but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man 's soul .
there is , and can be , no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all causes .
but there are laws directing events , and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we can not comprehend .
they <unk> the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to whom the honor is due .
even foreign historians , including the french , acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of that flank march .
but it is hard to understand why military <unk> , and following them others , consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon .
so it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this <unk> was a profound one .
if the position of the russian army really began to improve from the time of that march , it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it .
that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the russian army , but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction .
what would have happened had moscow not burned down ?
if murat had not lost sight of the russians ?
if napoleon had not remained inactive ?
if the russian army at <unk> <unk> had given battle as bennigsen and barclay advised ?
what would have happened had the french attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the <unk> ?
what would have happened if on approaching <unk> , napoleon had attacked the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at smol'ensk ?
what would have happened had the french moved on petersburg ? ...
in any of these <unk> the flank march that brought salvation might have proved <unk> .
at the council at fil'i the <unk> thought in the minds of the russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself , namely , a direct retreat by the n'izhni road .
this was the first indication of the necessity of <unk> from what had previously seemed the most natural course - a direct retreat on n'izhni - <unk> .
the army turned more to the south , along the ryaz'an road and nearer to its supplies .
just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to abandon moscow , so it is impossible to say <unk> when , or by whom , it was decided to move to <unk> .
only when the army had got there , as the result of innumerable and <unk> forces , did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result .
chapter ii
at <unk> kut'uzov received what was almost a <unk> from the emperor for having moved his army along the ryaz'an road , and the emperor 's letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near kal'uga .
kut'uzov 's merit lay , not in any strategic <unk> of genius , as it is called , but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened .
the beast wounded at borodin'o was lying where the fleeing <unk> had left him ; but whether he was still alive , whether he was strong and merely lying low , the <unk> did not know .
suddenly the beast was heard to moan .
the moan of that wounded beast ( the french army ) which betrayed its <unk> condition was the sending of <unk> to kut'uzov 's camp with <unk> for peace .
napoleon , with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was right , wrote to kut'uzov the first words that occurred to him , though they were meaningless .
monsieur le prince <unk> :
i am sending one of my adjutants - general to discuss several interesting questions with you .
i beg your highness to credit what he says to you , especially when he <unk> the sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your person .
this letter having no other object , i pray god , monsieur le prince <unk> , to keep you in his holy and gracious protection !
napoleon
moscow , october 30 , 1812
kut'uzov replied : " i should be <unk> by posterity were i looked on as the <unk> of a <unk> of any sort .
such is the present spirit of my nation . "
but he continued to <unk> all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking .
though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown to the russians , as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by <unk> signs .
there was a <unk> change in the relative strength , and an advance had become inevitable .
chapter iii
the russian army was commanded by kut'uzov and his staff , and also by the emperor from petersburg .
before the news of the abandonment of moscow had been received in petersburg , a <unk> plan of the whole campaign had been drawn up and sent to kut'uzov for his guidance .
though this plan had been drawn up on the <unk> that moscow was still in our hands , it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action .
kut'uzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute .
so fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered , as well as fresh people who were to watch kut'uzov 's actions and report upon them .
besides this , the whole staff of the russian army was now <unk> .
the posts left vacant by bagrati'on , who had been killed , and by barclay , who had gone away in <unk> , had to be filled .
a was <unk> <unk> , d was <unk> <unk> , and so on in all possible <unk> and <unk> .
only in the highest <unk> did all these <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen .
prince michael ilari'onovich !
( wrote the emperor on the second of october in a letter that reached kut'uzov after the battle at <unk> )
since september 2 moscow has been in the hands of the enemy .
<unk> is already occupied by an enemy detachment and <unk> with its famous <unk> so <unk> to the army , is in danger .
from general wintzingerode 's reports , i see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the petersburg road .
another corps of several thousand men is moving on <unk> .
a third has advanced along the vlad'imir road , and a fourth , rather considerable detachment is stationed between <unk> and mozh'aysk .
napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the twenty - fifth .
on the contrary , he is probably pursuing you with <unk> , or at most with an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you .
remember that you have still to answer to our offended country for the loss of moscow .
you have experienced my readiness to reward you .
on the second of october a cossack , <unk> , who was out <unk> , killed one hare and wounded another .
following the wounded hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of murat 's army , encamped there without any <unk> .
the cossack <unk> told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the french .
a cornet , hearing the story , informed his commander .
the cossack was sent for and questioned .
the cossack officers wished to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses , but one of the superior officers , who was acquainted with the higher authorities , reported the incident to a general on the staff .
the state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained .
erm'olov had been to see bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his influence with the commander in chief to <unk> him to take the offensive .
" if i did not know you i should think you did not want what you are asking for .
i need only advise anything and his highness is sure to do the opposite , " replied bennigsen .
the cossack 's report , confirmed by horse <unk> who were sent out , was the final proof that events had <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> spring was released , the clock began to <unk> and the <unk> to play .
chapter iv
bennigsen 's note and the cossack 's information that the left flank of the french was <unk> were merely final <unk> that it was necessary to order an attack , and it was fixed for the fifth of october .
on the morning of the fourth of october kut'uzov signed the dispositions .
toll read them to erm'olov , asking him to attend to the further arrangements .
" all right - all right .
i have n't time just now , " replied erm'olov , and left the hut .
the dispositions drawn up by toll were very good .
as in the austerlitz dispositions , it was written - though not in german this time :
everything had been <unk> thought out as is usual in dispositions , and as is always the case , not a single column reached its place at the appointed time .
when the necessary number of <unk> of the dispositions had been prepared , an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to erm'olov to deal with .
a young officer of the horse guards , kut'uzov 's orderly , pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him , went to erm'olov 's quarters .
" gone away , " said erm'olov 's orderly .
the officer of the horse guards went to a general with whom erm'olov was often to be found .
" no , and the general 's out too . "
the officer , mounting his horse , rode off to someone else .
" no , he 's gone out . "
" if only they do n't make me responsible for this delay !
what a nuisance it is ! "
thought the officer , and he rode round the whole camp .
one man said he had seen erm'olov ride past with some other generals , others said he must have returned home .
the officer <unk> till six o'clock in the evening without even stopping to eat .
erm'olov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was .
the officer snatched a little food at a comrade 's , and rode again to the vanguard to find milor'adovich .
milor'adovich too was away , but here he was told that he had gone to a ball at general <unk> 's and that erm'olov was probably there too .
" but where is it ? "
" why , there , over at ' <unk> , " said a cossack officer , pointing to a country house in the far distance .
" what , outside our line ? "
" they 've put two regiments as outposts , and they 're having such a <unk> there , it 's awful !
two bands and three sets of singers ! "
the officer rode out beyond our lines to ' <unk> .
while still at a distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier 's dance song proceeding from the house .
" in the <unk> ... in the <unk> ! " he heard , accompanied by whistling and the sound of a <unk> , drowned every now and then by shouts .
these sounds made his spirits rise , but at the same time he was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order entrusted to him .
it was already past eight o'clock .
he dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained intact between the russian and french forces .
in the <unk> room and the hall , footmen were bustling about with wine and <unk> .
groups of singers stood outside the windows .
the officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together , and among them erm'olov 's big imposing figure .
they all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a <unk> with flushed and animated faces , laughing loudly .
in the middle of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the <unk> with much spirit and agility .
" ha , ha , ha !
bravo , nicholas iv'anych !
ha , ha , ha ! "
erm'olov came forward with a frown on his face and , hearing what the officer had to say , took the papers from him without a word .
" you think he went off just by chance ? " said a comrade , who was on the staff that evening , to the officer of the horse guards , referring to erm'olov .
" it was a trick .
it was done on purpose to get konovn'itsyn into trouble .
you 'll see what a mess there 'll be tomorrow . "
chapter v
he sat in the cal`eche , dozing and waking up by turns , and listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun .
but all was still quiet .
a damp dull autumn morning was just <unk> .
on approaching <unk> kut'uzov noticed <unk> leading their horses to water across the road along which he was driving .
kut'uzov looked at them <unk> , stopped his carriage , and inquired what regiment they belonged to .
they belonged to a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long before then .
" it may be a mistake , " thought the old commander in chief .
but a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers , only partly dressed , eating their rye <unk> and carrying <unk> .
he sent for an officer .
the officer reported that no order to advance had been received .
" how ! not <unk> ... " kut'uzov began , but checked himself immediately and sent for a senior officer .
getting out of his cal`eche , he waited with drooping head and breathing heavily , pacing silently up and down .
another man , captain <unk> , who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame , suffered the same fate .
" what sort of another <unk> are you ?
i 'll have you shot !
scoundrels ! "
yelled kut'uzov in a hoarse voice , waving his arms and <unk> .
he was suffering physically .
he , the commander in chief , a serene highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had in russia , to be placed in this position - made the <unk> of the whole army !
" i need n't have been in such a hurry to pray about today , or have kept awake thinking everything over all night , " thought he to himself .
" when i was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to <unk> me so ... and now ! "
he was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal <unk> , and could not avoid expressing it by cries of anger and distress .
but his strength soon began to fail him , and looking about him , conscious of having said much that was amiss , he again got into his cal`eche and drove back in silence .
and once more kut'uzov had to consent .
chapter vi
next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening and advanced during the night .
it was an autumn night with dark purple clouds , but no rain .
the ground was damp but not muddy , and the troops advanced noiselessly , only occasionally a jingling of the artillery could be <unk> heard .
the men were forbidden to talk out loud , to smoke their pipes , or to <unk> a light , and they tried to prevent their horses <unk> .
the secrecy of the undertaking <unk> its charm and they marched gaily .
only count orl'ov - den'isov with his cossacks ( the least important detachment of all ) got to his appointed place at the right time .
this detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest , on the path leading from the village of <unk> to <unk> .
toward dawn , count orl'ov - den'isov , who had dozed off , was awakened by a <unk> from the french army being brought to him .
he said that murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were , and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him alive .
count orl'ov - den'isov <unk> his fellow officers .
the offer was too <unk> to be refused .
everyone <unk> to go and everybody advised making the attempt .
after much disputing and arguing , major - general <unk> with two cossack regiments decided to go with the polish sergeant .
without replying , the sergeant , with a resolute air , mounted and rode away with <unk> whose men had quickly assembled .
our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open <unk> to his right .
he looked in that direction , but though the columns would have been visible quite far off , they were not to be seen .
it seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the french camp , and his keen - sighted adjutant confirmed this .
" oh , it is really too late , " said count orl'ov , looking at the camp .
how could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops !
" i am sure that rascal was lying , " said the count .
" they can still be called back , " said one of his suite , who like count orl'ov felt <unk> of the <unk> when he looked at the enemy 's camp .
" eh ?
really ... what do you think ?
should we let them go on or not ? "
" will you have them fetched back ? "
" fetch them back , fetch them back ! " said count orl'ov with sudden determination , looking at his watch .
" it will be too late .
it is quite light . "
and the adjutant galloped through the forest after <unk> .
all his men felt the same excitement .
" mount ! " he commanded in a whisper .
the men took their places and crossed themselves .... "
forward , with god 's aid ! "
" hurrah - ah - ah ! "
reverberated in the forest , and the cossack companies , <unk> their <unk> and advancing one after another as if poured out of a sack , dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp .
had the cossacks pursued the french , without heeding what was behind and around them , they would have captured murat and everything there .
that was what the officers desired .
but it was impossible to make the cossacks <unk> when once they had got <unk> and prisoners .
none of them listened to orders .
fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty - eight guns were taken on the spot , besides standards and ( what seemed most important to the cossacks ) horses , saddles , horsecloths , and the like .
the french , not being farther pursued , began to recover themselves : they formed into <unk> and began firing .
orl'ov - den'isov , still waiting for the other columns to arrive , advanced no further .
as always happens the men , starting cheerfully , began to halt ; <unk> were heard , there was a sense of confusion , and finally a backward movement .
" we shall get somewhere or other ! "
toll , who in this battle played the part of weyrother at austerlitz , galloped <unk> from place to place , finding everything <unk> down everywhere .
thus he stumbled on <unk> 's corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight , though the corps should long before have joined orl'ov - den'isov .
excited and vexed by the <unk> and supposing that someone must be responsible for it , toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began <unk> him severely , saying that he ought to be shot .
" i prefer not to take lessons from anyone , but i can die with my men as well as anybody , " he said , and advanced with a single division .
danger , cannon balls , and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood .
one of the first bullets killed him , and other bullets killed many of his men .
and his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly .
chapter vii
meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front , but kut'uzov accompanied that column .
he well knew that nothing but confusion would come of this battle <unk> against his will , and as far as was in his power held the troops back .
he did not advance .
he rode silently on his small gray horse , indolently answering <unk> that they should attack .
" the word attack is always on your tongue , but you do n't see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers , " said he to milor'adovich who asked permission to advance .
" we could n't take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in time , and nothing can be done now ! "
he replied to someone else .
" you see !
they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds , but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready , and the enemy , <unk> , takes <unk> accordingly . "
erm'olov screwed up his eyes and smiled <unk> on hearing these words .
he understood that for him the storm had blown over , and that kut'uzov would content himself with that <unk> .
" he 's having a little fun at my expense , " said erm'olov softly , <unk> with his knee ra'evski who was at his side .
soon after this , erm'olov moved up to kut'uzov and respectfully remarked :
" it is not too late yet , your highness - the enemy has not gone away - if you were to order an attack !
if not , the guards will not so much as see a little smoke . "
kut'uzov did not reply , but when they reported to him that murat 's troops were in retreat he ordered an advance , though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour .
the whole battle consisted in what orl'ov - den'isov 's cossacks had done : the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly .
but people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about or deliberately deceive themselves .
no battle - <unk> , borodin'o , or austerlitz - takes place as those who planned it <unk> .
that is an essential condition .
if in the <unk> given by historians , especially french ones , we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously formed plans , the only conclusion to be drawn is that those <unk> are false .
it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more <unk> than the actual <unk> of this battle .
chapter viii
napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la <unk> ; there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the french .
the russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital .
moscow , <unk> in provisions , arms , <unk> , and incalculable wealth , is in napoleon 's hands .
the russian army , only half the strength of the french , does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month .
napoleon 's position is most brilliant .
yet napoleon , that greatest of all <unk> , who the historians declare had control of the army , took none of these steps .
he not merely did nothing of the kind , but on the contrary he used his power to select the most foolish and <unk> of all the <unk> open to him .
nothing more stupid than that could have been devised , or more <unk> for the army , as the <unk> showed .
had napoleon 's aim been to destroy his army , the most skillful <unk> could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose , independently of anything the russian army might do .
napoleon , the man of genius , did this !
in both cases his personal activity , having no more force than the personal activity of any soldier , merely <unk> with the laws that guided the event .
the historians quite <unk> represent napoleon 's faculties as having weakened in moscow , and do so only because the results did not justify his actions .
he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could for himself and his army , as he had done previously and as he did subsequently in <unk> .
his activity at that time was no less <unk> than it was in <unk> , in <unk> , in austria , and in prussia .
we do not know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in <unk> - where forty <unk> looked down upon his grandeur - for his great exploits there are all told us by frenchmen .
but we , thank god , have no need to recognize his genius in order to hide our shame .
we have paid for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply , and we will not abandon that right .
his activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere .
order after order and plan after plan were issued by him from the time he entered moscow till the time he left it .
the absence of <unk> and of a deputation , and even the burning of moscow , did not <unk> him .
chapter ix
then he gave careful directions about the fortification of the kr'emlin , and drew up a brilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole map of russia .
having <unk> explained his views and his magnanimity to <unk> , he dispatched that old man also to petersburg to negotiate .
with regard to legal matters , immediately after the fires he gave orders to find and execute the <unk> .
and the scoundrel rostopch'in was punished by an order to burn down his houses .
with regard to <unk> matters , moscow was granted a <unk> .
a <unk> was established and the following announcement issued :
inhabitants of moscow !
your misfortunes are cruel , but his majesty the emperor and king desires to arrest their course .
terrible examples have taught you how he punishes <unk> and crime .
strict <unk> have been taken to put an end to disorder and to re - establish public <unk> .
a paternal <unk> , chosen from among yourselves , will form your <unk> or city government .
it will take care of you , of your needs , and of your welfare .
its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder , and the <unk> of the city will wear a white belt as well .
but when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm .
the city police is established on its former footing , and better order already prevails in consequence of its activity .
the government has appointed two <unk> general , or <unk> of police , and twenty <unk> or <unk> of wards have been appointed to the different wards of the city .
you will recognize them by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm .
several churches of different <unk> are open , and divine service is performed in them <unk> .
your fellow <unk> are returning every day to their homes and orders have been given that they should find in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes .
these are the <unk> the government has adopted to re - establish order and relieve your condition .
* as <unk> .
with regard to religion , napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back and services to be again performed in the churches .
with regard to <unk> and to <unk> the army , the following was <unk> everywhere :
proclamation
you , peaceful inhabitants of moscow , <unk> and workmen whom misfortune has driven from the city , and you scattered <unk> of the soil , still kept out in the fields by <unk> fear , listen !
tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in it .
your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places on finding that they are respected .
any violence to them or to their property is promptly punished .
his majesty the emperor and king <unk> them , and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey his orders .
he desires to end your misfortunes and restore you to your homes and families .
respond , therefore , to his <unk> intentions and come to us without fear .
inhabitants , return with confidence to your <unk> !
you will soon find means of <unk> your needs .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> , return to your work , your houses , your shops , where the protection of guards awaits you !
you shall receive proper pay for your work .
and <unk> you too , peasants , come from the forests where you are hiding in terror , return to your huts without fear , in full assurance that you will find protection !
<unk> are established in the city where peasants can bring their <unk> supplies and the <unk> of the soil .
( 4 ) similar <unk> will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey .
( 5 ) steps will immediately be taken to re - establish ordinary <unk> .
lay your respect and confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us !
with the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people , reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed .
the emperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants , and , despite his <unk> with state affairs , himself visited the theaters that were established by his order .
in regard to <unk> , the greatest virtue of crowned heads , napoleon also did all in his power .
he caused the words maison de ma m`ere to be <unk> on the charitable institutions , thereby <unk> tender <unk> affection with the majestic <unk> of a monarch .
he visited the <unk> hospital and , <unk> the <unk> saved by him to kiss his white hands , graciously <unk> with <unk> .
with reference to army discipline , orders were continually being issued to inflict severe <unk> for the <unk> of military duties and to suppress robbery .
chapter x
the <unk> of the kr'emlin , for which la <unk> ( as napoleon termed the church of <unk> the <unk> ) was to have been <unk> to the ground , proved quite useless .
the <unk> of the kr'emlin only helped toward fulfilling napoleon 's wish that it should be blown up when he left moscow - as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten .
the pursuit of the russian army , about which napoleon was so concerned , produced an unheard - of result .
with regard to legal matters , after the execution of the supposed <unk> the rest of moscow burned down .
with regard to religion , as to which in <unk> matters had so easily been settled by napoleon 's visit to a <unk> , no results were achieved .
that night the doors were again broken open , the <unk> smashed , the books <unk> , and other <unk> <unk> . "
with reference to <unk> , the proclamation to <unk> workmen and to peasants evoked no <unk> .
there were no <unk> workmen , and the peasants caught the <unk> who ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them .
as to the theaters for the <unk> of the people and the troops , these did not meet with success either .
the theaters set up in the kr'emlin and in <unk> 's house were closed again at once because the actors and <unk> were <unk> .
even <unk> did not have the desired effect .
the genuine as well as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value .
the french , collecting <unk> , cared only for gold .
not only was the paper money <unk> which napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate , but even silver lost its value in relation to gold .
but the most amazing example of the <unk> of the orders given by the authorities at that time was napoleon 's attempt to stop the looting and re - establish discipline .
this is what the army authorities were reporting :
" looting <unk> in the city despite the <unk> against it .
order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on <unk> in a <unk> manner .
the sutlers alone venture to <unk> , and they sell stolen goods . "
" nothing new , except that the soldiers are <unk> and <unk> - october <unk> . "
" robbery and <unk> continue .
there is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force - october 11 . "
" the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop <unk> , parties of <unk> guards are continually seen returning to the kr'emlin .
among the old guard disorder and <unk> were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening , last night , and today .
others have disgraced themselves to the extent of <unk> sentinels and officers , and have <unk> and beaten them . "
that army , like a <unk> of cattle run wild and trampling <unk> the <unk> which might have saved it from <unk> , <unk> and perished with each <unk> day it remained in moscow .
but it did not go away .
it began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the capture of transport <unk> on the smol'ensk road , and by the battle of <unk> .
fleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had stolen .
napoleon , too , carried away his own personal <unk> , but on seeing the baggage <unk> that <unk> the army , he was ( thiers says ) horror - struck .
and yet with his experience of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned , as he had done with those of a certain marshal when approaching moscow .
he gazed at the cal`eches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing , as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions , the sick , and the wounded .
the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is <unk> and does not know what it is doing .
to study the skillful <unk> and aims of napoleon and his army from the time it entered moscow till it was destroyed is like <unk> the dying <unk> and <unk> of a <unk> wounded animal .
very often a wounded animal , hearing a rustle , <unk> straight at the <unk> 's gun , runs forward and back again , and <unk> its own end .
napoleon , under pressure from his whole army , did the same thing .
chapter xi
this little dog lived in their shed , sleeping beside karat'aev at night ; it sometimes made <unk> into the town but always returned again .
probably it had never had an owner , and it still belonged to nobody and had no name .
the french called it <unk> ; the soldier who told stories called it <unk> ; karat'aev and others called it gray , or sometimes flabby .
its lack of a master , a name , or even of a <unk> or any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue - gray dog in the least .
everything pleased it .
now it would roll on its back , <unk> with delight , now <unk> in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance , and now <unk> about playing with a chip of wood or a straw .
physically he had changed much during this time .
he no longer seemed stout , though he still had the appearance of <unk> and strength <unk> in his family .
a beard and mustache covered the lower part of his face , and a <unk> of hair , <unk> with <unk> , curled round his head like a cap .
the look of his eyes was resolute , calm , and <unk> alert , as never before .
the former <unk> which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an energetic readiness for action and <unk> .
his feet were bare .
every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of animated self - satisfaction flitted across his face .
the sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him .
for some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight <unk> in the <unk> - what is called an " old wives ' summer . "
in the sunshine the air was warm , and that warmth was particularly pleasant with the <unk> freshness of the morning frost still in the air .
on everything - far and near - lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at that time of autumn .
the <unk> hills were visible in the distance , with the village , the church , and the large white house .
near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half - burned <unk> occupied by the french , with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence .
and even that ruined and <unk> house - which in dull weather was <unk> ugly - seemed quietly beautiful now , in the clear , motionless <unk> .
" what sunshine , monsieur <unk> ! "
( their name for pierre . )
" eh ? just like spring ! "
and the corporal leaned against the door and offered pierre his pipe , though whenever he offered it pierre always declined it .
" to be on the march in such weather ... " he began .
pierre inquired what was being said about leaving , and the corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order about the prisoners that day .
<unk> , one of the soldiers in the shed with pierre , was dying , and pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him .
" besides , monsieur <unk> , you have only to say a word to the captain , you know .
he is a man who never forgets anything .
speak to the captain when he makes his round , he will do anything for you . "
( the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long <unk> with pierre and showed him all sorts of favors . )
" ' you see , st. <unk> , ' he said to me the other day . '
monsieur <unk> is a man of education , who speaks french .
he is a russian <unk> who has had misfortunes , but he is a man .
he knows what 's what ....
if he wants anything and asks me , he wo n't get a refusal .
when one has studied , you see , one likes education and well - bred people . '
it is for your sake i mention it , monsieur <unk> .
the other day if it had not been for you that affair would have ended ill . "
and after <unk> a while longer , the corporal went away .
( the affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before - a fight between the prisoners and the french soldiers , in which pierre had succeeded in <unk> his comrades . )
some of the prisoners who had heard pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchman had said .
while pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving moscow , a thin , sallow , tattered french soldier came up to the door of the shed .
rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting , he asked pierre whether the soldier <unk> to whom he had given a shirt to <unk> was in that shed .
a week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to them , which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts for them .
" ready , ready , dear fellow ! "
said karat'aev , coming out with a neatly folded shirt .
karat'aev , on account of the warm weather and for <unk> at work , was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as <unk> .
his hair was bound round , workman fashion , with a <unk> of lime - tree bast , and his round face seemed <unk> and <unk> than ever .
" a promise is own brother to performance !
i said friday and here it is , ready , " said plat'on , smiling and <unk> the shirt he had <unk> .
the frenchman glanced around uneasily and then , as if <unk> his hesitation , rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt .
he had a long , <unk> , <unk> silk waistcoat next to his sallow , thin bare body , but no shirt .
he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh at him , and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly .
none of the prisoners said a word .
" see , it fits well ! "
plat'on kept repeating , pulling the shirt straight .
the frenchman , having pushed his head and hands through , without raising his eyes , looked down at the shirt and examined the <unk> .
" it 's good , quite good , thank you , " said the frenchman , in french , " but there must be some linen left over . "
" it will fit better still when it sets to your body , " said karat'aev , still <unk> his <unk> .
" you 'll be nice and comfortable .... "
" thanks , thanks , old fellow ....
but the <unk> left over ? " said the frenchman again and smiled .
he took out an <unk> ruble note and gave it to karat'aev . "
but give me the pieces that are over . "
pierre saw that plat'on did not want to understand what the frenchman was saying , and he looked on without <unk> .
karat'aev thanked the frenchman for the money and went on <unk> his own work .
the frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked pierre to <unk> what he said .
" what does he want the <unk> for ? " said karat'aev .
" they 'd make fine leg bands for us .
well , never mind . "
and karat'aev , with a suddenly changed and <unk> expression , took a small <unk> of <unk> from inside his shirt and gave it to the frenchman without looking at him . "
oh dear ! "
muttered karat'aev and went away .
the frenchman looked at the linen , considered for a moment , then looked inquiringly at pierre and , as if pierre 's look had told him something , suddenly blushed and shouted in a <unk> voice :
" <unk> !
eh , <unk> !
keep them yourself ! "
and handing back the <unk> <unk> he turned and went out .
" there , look at that , " said karat'aev , swaying his head .
" people said they were not christians , but they too have souls .
it 's what the old folk used to say : ' a <unk> hand 's an open hand , a dry hand 's close . '
he 's naked , but yet he 's given it back . "
karat'aev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces .
" but they 'll make grand leg bands , dear friend , " he said , and went back into the shed .
chapter xii
and just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly <unk> in vain to reach .
he had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind , that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of borodin'o .
and now without thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death , through <unk> , and through what he recognized in karat'aev .
those dreadful moments he had lived through at the <unk> had as it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important .
it did not now occur to him to think of russia , or the war , or politics , or napoleon .
it was plain to him that all these things were no business of his , and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so . "
russia and summer weather are not bound together , " he thought , repeating words of karat'aev 's which he found strangely consoling .
his intention of killing napoleon and his <unk> of the <unk> number of the beast of the apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous .
his anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be <unk> now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing .
what <unk> was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred ?
what did it matter to anybody , and especially to him , whether or not they found out that their prisoner 's name was count bez'ukhov ?
he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and quite agreed with him , though he understood prince andrew 's thoughts somewhat differently .
but pierre believed it without any mental <unk> .
all pierre 's <unk> now turned on the time when he would be free .
and this not only stayed with him during the whole of his <unk> , but even grew in strength as the <unk> of his position increased .
that feeling of <unk> and of readiness for anything was still further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed .
the very qualities that had been a hindrance , if not actually harmful , to him in the world he had lived in - his strength , his <unk> for the comforts of life ,
his absent - mindedness and simplicity - here among these people gave him almost the <unk> of a hero .
and pierre felt that their opinion placed <unk> upon him .
chapter xiii
the french <unk> began on the night between the sixth and seventh of october : <unk> and <unk> were <unk> , carts loaded , and troops and baggage <unk> started .
in the shed everyone was ready , dressed , <unk> , <unk> , and only awaited the order to start .
the sick soldier , <unk> , pale and thin with dark shadows round his eyes , alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed .
his eyes , prominent from the <unk> of his face , gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention to him , and he moaned regularly and quietly .
it was evidently not so much his sufferings that caused him to moan ( he had <unk> ) as his fear and grief at being left alone .
" you know , <unk> , they are not all going away !
they have a hospital here .
you may be better off than we others , " said pierre .
" o lord !
oh , it will be the death of me !
o lord ! " moaned the man in a louder voice .
" i 'll go and ask them again directly , " said pierre , rising and going to the door of the shed .
just as pierre reached the door , the corporal who had offered him a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers .
the corporal and soldiers were in marching <unk> with knapsacks and shakos that had metal <unk> , and these changed their familiar faces .
the corporal came , according to orders , to shut the door .
the prisoners had to be counted before being let out .
" corporal , what will they do with the sick man ? ... " pierre began .
but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he knew or a stranger , so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment .
moreover , just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly heard from both sides .
the corporal frowned at pierre 's words and , uttering some meaningless <unk> , slammed the door .
the shed became <unk> , and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick man 's groans .
" there it is ! ...
it again ! ... " said pierre to himself , and an involuntary shudder ran down his spine .
to fear or to try to escape that force , to address entreaties or <unk> to those who served as its tools , was useless .
pierre knew this now .
one had to wait and endure .
he did not again go to the sick man , nor turn to look at him , but stood frowning by the door of the hut .
the captain was also in marching <unk> , and on his cold face appeared that same it which pierre had recognized in the corporal 's words and in the roll of the drums .
" pass on , pass on ! "
the captain <unk> , frowning sternly , and looking at the prisoners who thronged past him .
pierre went up to him , though he knew his attempt would be vain .
" what now ? "
the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing pierre .
pierre told him about the sick man .
" he 'll manage to walk , devil take him ! " said the captain . "
pass on , pass on ! "
he continued without looking at pierre .
" but he is dying , " pierre again began .
" be so good ... " shouted the captain , frowning angrily .
" <unk> - <unk> - <unk> - dam , dam - dam ... " rattled the drums , and pierre understood that this mysterious force completely <unk> these men and that it was now useless to say any more .
the officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march in front .
there were about thirty officers , with pierre among them , and about three hundred men .
the officers , who had come from the other <unk> , were all strangers to pierre and much better dressed than he .
they looked at him and at his shoes <unk> , as at an alien .
he kept one hand , in which he clasped his tobacco pouch , inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the <unk> of his pipe firmly with the other .
another , a thin little officer , was speaking to everyone , <unk> where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day .
a third officer , who by his accent was a pole , disputed with the commissariat officer , arguing that he was mistaken in his <unk> of the different wards of moscow .
" what are you disputing about ? " said the major angrily .
" what does it matter whether it is st. nicholas or st. <unk> ?
you see it 's burned down , and there 's an end of it ....
what are you pushing for ?
is n't the road wide enough ? " said he , turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at all .
" oh , oh , oh !
what have they done ?
" the prisoners on one side and another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins .
" all beyond the river , and z'ubova , and in the kr'emlin .... just look !
there 's not half of it left .
yes , i told you - the whole quarter beyond the river , and so it is . "
" well , you know it 's burned , so what 's the use of talking ? " said the major .
as they passed near a church in the <unk> ( one of the few <unk> quarters of moscow )
the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one side and <unk> of horror and disgust were heard .
" ah , the villains !
what <unk> !
yes ; dead , dead , so he is ...
and smeared with something ! "
pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these <unk> , and dimly made out something leaning against the <unk> surrounding the church .
from the words of his comrades who saw better than he did , he found that this was the body of a man , set upright against the <unk> with its face smeared with <unk> .
" go on !
what the devil ...
go on !
thirty thousand devils ! ...
" the convoy guards began <unk> and the french soldiers , with fresh <unk> , drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead man .
chapter xiv
at the bridge they all halted , waiting for those in front to get across .
from the bridge they had a view of <unk> lines of moving baggage <unk> before and behind them .
to the right , where the kal'uga road turns near <unk> , <unk> rows of troops and carts stretched away into the distance .
these were troops of <unk> ' corps which had started before any of the others .
behind , along the <unk> and across the stone bridge , were ney 's troops and transport .
davout 's troops , in whose charge were the prisoners , were crossing the <unk> bridge and some were already <unk> into the kal'uga road .
when they had crossed the <unk> bridge the prisoners moved a few steps forward , halted , and again moved on , and from all sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together .
from all sides , like the roar of the sea , were heard the rattle of wheels , the tramp of feet , and incessant shouts of anger and abuse .
pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house , listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums .
to get a better view , several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of the half - burned house against which pierre was leaning .
" what crowds !
just look at the crowds ! ...
they 've loaded goods even on the cannon !
look there , those are <unk> ! "
they exclaimed . "
just see what the blackguards have <unk> ....
there !
see what that one has behind in the cart ....
why , those are <unk> taken from some icons , by heaven ! ...
oh , the rascals ! ...
see how that fellow has loaded himself up , he can hardly walk !
good lord , they 've even <unk> those <unk> ! ...
see that fellow there sitting on the trunks ....
heavens !
they 're fighting . "
" that 's right , hit him on the <unk> - on his <unk> !
like this , we sha n't get away before evening .
look , look there ....
why , that must be napoleon 's own .
see what horses !
and the <unk> with a crown !
it 's like a <unk> house ....
that fellow 's dropped his sack and does n't see it .
fighting again ...
a woman with a baby , and not bad - looking either !
yes , i dare say , that 's the way they 'll let you pass ....
just look , there 's no end to it .
russian <unk> , by heaven , so they are !
in carriages - see how comfortably they 've settled themselves ! "
in three carriages <unk> among the <unk> carts , closely squeezed together , sat women with <unk> faces , dressed in <unk> colors , who were shouting something in shrill voices .
all that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on him - as if his soul , making ready for a hard struggle , refused to receive impressions that might <unk> it .
the women 's vehicles drove by .
behind them came more carts , soldiers , wagons , soldiers , gun carriages , carriages , soldiers , ammunition carts , more soldiers , and now and then women .
pierre did not see the people as <unk> but saw their movement .
all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power .
they marched very quickly , without resting , and halted only when the sun began to set .
the baggage carts drew up close together and the men began to prepare for their night 's rest .
they all appeared angry and dissatisfied .
for a long time , <unk> , angry shouts , and fighting could be heard from all sides .
a carriage that followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked a <unk> in it with its pole .
once at a <unk> they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going , and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey .
during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start .
it was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their meat <unk> .
from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners , in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations .
this spite increased still more when , on calling over the roll of prisoners , it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russian soldier , who had pretended to suffer from <unk> , had escaped .
to the noncommissioned officer 's excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk , the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who <unk> behind .
pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the <unk> , but which he had not felt during his <unk> , now again <unk> his existence .
it was terrible , but he felt that in <unk> to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him , there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it .
he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades .
as if in <unk> against the <unk> of their position they were all particularly animated and gay .
they spoke of personal reminiscences , of amusing <unk> they had witnessed during the campaign , and avoided all talk of their present situation .
the sun had set long since .
bright stars shone out here and there in the sky .
a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon , and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray <unk> .
it grew light .
the evening was ending , but the night had not yet come .
pierre got up and left his new companions , crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed .
he wanted to talk to them .
on the road he was stopped by a french <unk> who ordered him back .
pierre turned back , not to his companions by the campfire , but to an <unk> cart where there was nobody .
<unk> his legs under him and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought .
suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad , good - natured laughter , so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean .
" ha - ha - ha ! " laughed pierre .
and he said aloud to himself : " the soldier did not let me pass .
they took me and shut me up .
they hold me captive .
what , me ?
me ?
my <unk> soul ?
ha - ha - ha !
ha - ha - ha ! ...
" and he laughed till tears started to his eyes .
a man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at all by himself .
pierre stopped laughing , got up , went farther away from the inquisitive man , and looked around him .
the huge , <unk> <unk> that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet , the red campfires were growing paler and dying down .
high up in the light sky hung the full moon .
forests and fields beyond the camp , unseen before , were now visible in the distance .
and farther still , beyond those forests and fields , the bright , <unk> , <unk> distance <unk> one to itself .
pierre glanced up at the sky and the <unk> stars in its <unk> depths . "
and all that is me , all that is within me , and it is all i ! " thought pierre . "
and they caught all that and put it into a shed <unk> up with planks ! "
he smiled , and went and lay down to sleep beside his companions .
chapter xv
in the early days of october another envoy came to kut'uzov with a letter from napoleon proposing peace and <unk> <unk> from moscow , though napoleon was already not far from kut'uzov on the old kal'uga road .
kut'uzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by <unk> , saying that there could be no question of peace .
the soldiers and officers again demanded action .
generals on the staff , excited by the memory of the easy victory at <unk> , urged kut'uzov to carry out <unk> 's suggestion .
kut'uzov did not consider any offensive necessary .
the result was a compromise which was inevitable : a small detachment was sent to <unk> to attack <unk> .
at austerlitz he remained last at the <unk> dam , <unk> the regiments , saving what was possible when all were flying and <unk> and not a single general was left in the rear guard .
ill with fever he went to smol'ensk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against napoleon 's whole army .
in smol'ensk , at the <unk> gate , he had hardly dozed off in a <unk> of fever before he was awakened by the <unk> of the town - and smol'ensk held out all day long .
and the quiet little dokht'urov rode thither , and borodin'o became the greatest glory of the russian army .
many <unk> have been described to us in verse and <unk> , but of dokht'urov scarcely a word has been said .
and this silence about dokht'urov is the <unk> <unk> to his merit .
at that time dokht'urov had under his command , besides <unk> 's detachment , the two small <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
on the evening of october 11 <unk> came to the <unk> headquarters with a french guardsman he had captured .
the prisoner said that the troops that had entered <unk> that day were the vanguard of the whole army , that napoleon was there and the whole army had left moscow four days previously .
that same evening a house serf who had come from <unk> said he had seen an immense army entering the town .
some cossacks of dokht'urov 's detachment reported having sighted the french guards marching along the road to <unk> .
from all these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpected direction - along the kal'uga road .
dokht'urov was unwilling to undertake any action , as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do .
he had been ordered to attack <unk> .
but only <unk> had been there at that time and now the whole french army was there .
erm'olov wished to act on his own judgment , but dokht'urov insisted that he must have kut'uzov 's instructions .
so it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff .
for this purpose a capable officer , <unk> , was chosen , who was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth , besides <unk> a written report .
toward midnight <unk> , having received the dispatch and verbal instructions , galloped off to the general staff accompanied by a cossack with spare horses .
chapter xvi
it was a warm , dark , autumn night .
it had been <unk> for four days .
having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a <unk> , muddy road , <unk> reached <unk> after one o'clock at night .
dismounting at a <unk> on whose wattle fence hung a <unk> , general staff , and throwing down his reins , he entered a dark passage .
" the general on duty , quick !
it 's very important ! "
said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage .
" he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he has not slept , " said the orderly <unk> in a whisper .
" you should wake the captain first . "
" but this is very important , from general dokht'urov , " said <unk> , entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark .
the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody .
" your honor , your honor !
a courier . "
" what ?
what 's that ?
from whom ? " came a sleepy voice .
" from dokht'urov and from <unk> <unk> .
napoleon is at <unk> , " said <unk> , unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not konovn'itsyn .
the man who had <unk> <unk> and stretched himself .
" i do n't like waking him , " he said , fumbling for something . "
he is very ill .
perhaps this is only a rumor . "
" here is the dispatch , " said <unk> .
" my orders are to give it at once to the general on duty . "
" wait a moment , i 'll light a candle .
you damned rascal , where do you always hide it ? " said the voice of the man who was stretching himself , to the orderly .
( this was <unk> , konovn'itsyn 's adjutant . )
" i 've found it , i 've found it ! "
he added .
the orderly was striking a light and <unk> was fumbling for something on the <unk> .
" oh , the nasty beasts ! " said he with disgust .
by the light of the sparks <unk> saw <unk> 's youthful face as he held the candle , and the face of another man who was still asleep .
this was konovn'itsyn .
<unk> was <unk> all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve .
" who gave the report ? " inquired <unk> , taking the envelope .
" the news is reliable , " said <unk> .
"
prisoners , cossacks , and the scouts all say the same thing . "
" there 's nothing to be done , we 'll have to wake him , " said <unk> , rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat . "
peter <unk> ! " said he .
( konovn'itsyn did not stir . )
"
to the general staff !
" he said with a smile , knowing that those words would be sure to arouse him .
and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once .
" well , what is it ?
from whom ? " he asked immediately but without hurry , blinking at the light .
while listening to the officer 's report konovn'itsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch .
hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their <unk> stockings to the <unk> floor and began putting on his boots .
then he took off his nightcap , <unk> his hair over his temples , and donned his cap .
" did you get here quickly ?
let us go to his highness . "
konovn'itsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost .
he did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad .
that did not interest him .
he regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else .
there was within him a deep <unk> conviction that all would be well , but that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it , but must only attend to one 's own work .
and he did his work , giving his whole strength to the task .
peter <unk> konovn'itsyn , like dokht'urov , seems to have been included merely for <unk> 's sake in the list of the so - called <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
like dokht'urov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information , and like dokht'urov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult .
since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open , giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up .
and this <unk> was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped .
chapter xvii
kut'uzov like all old people did not sleep much at night .
he often fell asleep unexpectedly in the <unk> , but at night , lying on his bed without undressing , he generally remained awake thinking .
so he lay now on his bed , supporting his large , heavy , <unk> head on his plump hand , with his one eye open , meditating and peering into the darkness .
the lesson of the <unk> battle and of the day before it , which kut'uzov remembered with pain , must , he thought , have some effect on others too .
" they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive .
patience and time are my <unk> , my <unk> , " thought kut'uzov .
he knew that an apple should not be <unk> while it is green .
it will fall of itself when <unk> , but if picked <unk> the apple is spoiled , the tree is <unk> , and your teeth are set on edge .
like an experienced <unk> he knew that the beast was wounded , and wounded as only the whole strength of russia could have wounded it , but whether it was <unk> wounded or not was still an undecided question .
now by the fact of <unk> and <unk> having been sent , and by the reports of the <unk> , kut'uzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal .
but he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait .
" they want to run to see how they have wounded it .
wait and we shall see !
continual maneuvers , continual <unk> ! " thought he . "
what for ?
only to distinguish themselves !
as if fighting were fun .
they are like children from whom one ca n't get any sensible account of what has happened because they all want to show how well they can fight .
but that 's not what is needed now .
" and what <unk> maneuvers they all propose to me !
it seems to them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies " ( he remembered the general plan sent him from petersburg ) " they have foreseen everything .
but the contingencies are <unk> . "
the undecided question as to whether the wound <unk> at borodin'o was mortal or not had hung over kut'uzov 's head for a whole month .
on the one hand the french had occupied moscow .
on the other kut'uzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal .
but in any case proofs were needed ; he had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the longer he waited .
lying on his bed during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals for doing .
he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies , just like the younger men , but with this difference , that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them .
the longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves .
he imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or in <unk> - against petersburg , or against him , or to outflank him .
he thought too of the possibility ( which he feared most of all ) that napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow awaiting him .
but these were only <unk> , which seemed important to the younger men but not to kut'uzov .
and the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it .
this question absorbed all his mental powers .
all else was to him only life 's customary routine .
but the destruction of the french , which he alone <unk> , was his heart 's one desire .
on the night of the <unk> of october he lay leaning on his arm and thinking of that .
there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll , konovn'itsyn , and <unk> .
" eh , who 's there ?
come in , come in !
what news ?
" the field marshal called out to them .
while a footman was lighting a candle , toll communicated the substance of the news .
" who brought it ? " asked kut'uzov with a look which , when the candle was lit , struck toll by its cold severity .
" there can be no doubt about it , your highness . "
" call him in , call him here . "
kut'uzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big <unk> resting against the other which was doubled under him .
he screwed up his seeing eye to <unk> the messenger more carefully , as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his own mind .
" tell me , tell me , friend , " said he to <unk> in his low , aged voice , as he pulled together the shirt which <unk> open on his chest , " come nearer - nearer .
what news have you brought me ?
eh ?
that napoleon has left moscow ?
are you sure ?
eh ? "
<unk> gave a <unk> account from the beginning of all he had been told to report .
" speak quicker , quicker !
do n't torture me ! "
kut'uzov interrupted him .
<unk> told him everything and was then silent , awaiting instructions .
toll was beginning to say something but kut'uzov checked him .
" o lord , my creator , thou has heard our prayer ... " said he in a tremulous voice with folded hands .
" russia is saved .
i thank thee , o lord ! " and he wept .
chapter xviii
dokht'urov went to <unk> - <unk> , but kut'uzov lingered with the main army and gave orders for the <unk> of kal'uga - a retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible .
everywhere kut'uzov retreated , but the enemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the opposite direction .
napoleon 's historians describe to us his <unk> maneuvers at <unk> and <unk> - <unk> , and make conjectures as to what would have happened had napoleon been in time to <unk> into the rich southern provinces .
that army could not recover anywhere .
since the battle of borodin'o and the <unk> of moscow it had borne within itself , as it were , the <unk> elements of <unk> .
but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away , there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must <unk> .
an external shock was needed to overcome that shame , and this shock came in due time .
it was what the french called " le <unk> de l'empereur . "
some cossacks on the <unk> for <unk> fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him .
if the cossacks did not capture napoleon then , what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the french army , the <unk> on which the cossacks fell .
here as at <unk> they went after <unk> , leaving the men .
disregarding napoleon they rushed after the <unk> and napoleon managed to escape .
chapter xix
a man in motion always <unk> an aim for that motion .
to be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end of those thousand miles .
one must have the <unk> of a promised land to have the strength to move .
the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow , during their retreat it was their native land .
and the <unk> felt by a single person are always <unk> in a crowd .
so both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves , and pushed on to smol'ensk as to a promised land .
coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy and unheard - of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on .
besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy , there was another cause binding them together - their great numbers .
as with the physical law of gravity , their enormous mass drew the individual human <unk> to itself .
in their hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation .
their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the russians to stop this movement , to which the french were directing all their <unk> .
beyond a certain limit no <unk> <unk> of the body could hasten the process of <unk> .
a <unk> of snow can not be melted instantaneously .
there is a certain limit of time in less than which no <unk> of heat can <unk> the snow .
on the contrary the greater the heat the more <unk> the remaining snow becomes .
of the russian commanders kut'uzov alone understood this .
when the flight of the french army along the smol'ensk road became well defined , what konovn'itsyn had foreseen on the night of the <unk> of october began to occur .
the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves , to cut off , to seize , to capture , and to overthrow the french , and all <unk> for action .
kut'uzov alone used all his power ( and such power is very limited in the case of any commander in chief ) to prevent an attack .
he could not tell them what we say now : " why fight , why <unk> the road , losing our own men and <unk> <unk> unfortunate <unk> ?
what is the use of that , when a third of their army has melted away on the road from moscow to vy'azma without any battle ? "
but drawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand , he told them of the golden bridge , and they laughed at and <unk> him , <unk> themselves on , <unk> and <unk> over the dying beast .
erm'olov , milor'adovich , pl'atov , and others in proximity to the french near vy'azma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two french corps , and by way of reporting their intention to kut'uzov
they sent him a <unk> sheet of paper in an envelope .
and try as kut'uzov might to restrain the troops , our men attacked , trying to <unk> the road .
infantry regiments , we are told , advanced to the attack with music and with drums beating , and killed and lost thousands of men .
but they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army , closing up more firmly at the danger , continued , while steadily <unk> away , to <unk> its fatal path to smol'ensk .
book fourteen : 1812
chapter i
the battle of borodin'o , with the occupation of moscow that followed it and the flight of the french without further <unk> , is one of the most <unk> <unk> in history .
an army <unk> a victory , and at once the rights of the <unk> nation have increased to the <unk> of the defeated .
an army has suffered defeat , and at once a people loses its rights in <unk> to the severity of the reverse , and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite <unk> .
so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times , and so it is to our own day .
all napoleon 's wars serve to confirm this rule .
in <unk> to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses its rights , and the rights and the strength of france increase .
the victories of the french at <unk> and <unk> destroy the independent existence of prussia .
but then , in 1812 , the french gain a victory near moscow .
moscow is taken and after that , with no further battles , it is not russia that ceases to exist , but the french army of six hundred thousand , and then napoleonic france itself .
after the french victory at borodin'o there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious , yet the french army ceased to exist .
what does this mean ?
that was a misfortune no one could remedy , for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the french have it .
let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with <unk> according to all the rules of the art of <unk> .
one can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel .
after the burning of smol'ensk a war began which did not follow any previous <unk> of war .
chapter ii
one of the most obvious and advantageous <unk> from the so - called laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together in a mass .
such action always occurs in wars that take on a <unk> character .
in such actions , instead of two crowds <unk> each other , the men disperse , attack singly , run away when attacked by stronger forces , but again attack when opportunity <unk> .
this was done by the <unk> in spain , by the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and by the russians in 1812 .
people have called this kind of war " <unk> warfare " and assume that by so calling it they have explained its meaning .
but such a war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well - known rule of <unk> which is accepted as <unk> .
that rule says that an <unk> should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict .
<unk> war ( always successful , as history shows ) directly <unk> that rule .
this contradiction <unk> from the fact that military science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers .
military science says that the more troops the greater the strength .
les <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . *
* large battalions are always victorious .
for military science to say this is like <unk> <unk> in <unk> by reference to the mass only : <unk> that <unk> are equal or <unk> to each other simply because the masses <unk> are equal or <unk> .
<unk> ( quantity of motion ) is the <unk> of mass and <unk> .
in military affairs the strength of an army is the <unk> of its mass and some unknown <unk>
but the <unk> of these various <unk> to the <unk> does not yield results which accord with the historic facts .
yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view ( adopted to <unk> the " <unk> " ) of the <unk> of the directions issued in <unk> by commanders , in order to find this unknown quantity .
men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting .
the spirit of an army is the <unk> which <unk> by the mass gives the resulting force .
to <unk> and express the significance of this unknown <unk> - the spirit of an army - is a problem for science .
only then , expressing known historic facts by <unk> and <unk> the relative significance of this <unk> , can we hope to <unk> the unknown .
consequently the four were equal to the fifteen , and therefore <unk> <unk> <unk> .
consequently x <unk> y <unk> <unk> .
this <unk> does not give us the value of the unknown <unk> but gives us a <unk> between two <unk> .
and by bringing <unk> selected historic units ( battles , campaigns , <unk> of war ) into such <unk> , a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered .
the <unk> rule that an army should act in masses when attacking , and in smaller groups in retreat , unconsciously <unk> the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit .
to lead men forward under fire more discipline ( <unk> only by movement in masses ) is needed than is needed to resist attacks .
chapter iii
the so - called <unk> war began with the entry of the french into smol'ensk .
on august <unk> <unk> 's first <unk> detachment was formed and then others were recognized .
the further the campaign <unk> the more <unk> these <unk> became .
the <unk> destroyed the great army <unk> .
they gathered the fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that <unk> tree - the french army - and sometimes shook that tree itself .
by october , when the french were fleeing toward smol'ensk , there were hundreds of such companies , of various <unk> and characters .
there were some that adopted all the army methods and had infantry , artillery , staffs , and the comforts of life .
others consisted solely of cossack cavalry .
there were also small scratch groups of foot and horse , and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown .
a <unk> commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month ; and there was <unk> , the wife of a village elder , who <unk> hundreds of the french .
the <unk> warfare <unk> up most fiercely in the latter days of october .
by the end of october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape : it had become clear to all what could be ventured against the french and what could not .
now only the commanders of <unk> with staffs , and moving according to rules at a distance from the french , still regarded many things as impossible .
the small bands that had started their activities long before and had already observed the french closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big <unk> did not dare to <unk> .
the cossacks and peasants who crept in among the french now considered everything possible .
on october <unk> , den'isov ( who was one of the <unk> ) was with his group at the height of the <unk> enthusiasm .
since early morning he and his party had been on the move .
two of the commanders of large parties - one a pole and the other a german - sent invitations to den'isov almost simultaneously , <unk> him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy .
to the polish general he replied to the same effect , informing him that he was already under the command of the german .
having arranged matters thus , den'isov and d'olokhov intended , without reporting matters to the higher command , to attack and seize that convoy with their own small forces .
on october <unk> it was moving from the village of <unk> to that of <unk> .
to the left of the road between <unk> and <unk> there were large forests , <unk> in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back from it .
through these forests den'isov and his party rode all day , sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very edge , but never losing sight of the moving french .
since then , and until evening , the party had watched the movements of the french without attacking .
in their rear , more than a mile from <unk> where the forest came right up to the road , six cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of french should show themselves .
beyond <unk> , d'olokhov was to observe the road in the same way , to find out at what distance there were other french troops .
they <unk> that the convoy had fifteen hundred men .
den'isov had two hundred , and d'olokhov might have as many more , but the <unk> of numbers did not <unk> den'isov .
all that he now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a " tongue "- that is , a man from the enemy column .
chapter iv
it was a warm <unk> autumn day .
the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water .
at times a sort of mist descended , and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down .
den'isov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides .
like his horse , which turned its head and laid its ears back , he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him .
his thin face with its short , thick black beard looked angry .
beside den'isov rode an <unk> , * den'isov 's fellow <unk> , also in felt cloak and sheepskin cap , and riding a large sleek don horse .
* a captain of cossacks .
<unk> <unk>
the third was a tall man as straight as an <unk> , pale - faced , fair - haired , with narrow light eyes and with calm self - satisfaction in his face and bearing .
a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide , wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white <unk> cap .
a little behind , on a poor , small , lean <unk> mount with an enormous tail and <unk> and a bleeding mouth , rode a young officer in a blue french overcoat .
beside him rode an hussar , with a boy in a tattered french uniform and blue cap behind him on the <unk> of his horse .
the boy held on to the hussar with cold , red hands , and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise .
this was the french <unk> boy captured that morning .
behind them along the narrow , <unk> , <unk> forest road came hussars in threes and <unk> , and then cossacks : some in felt cloaks , some in french greatcoats , and some with horsecloths over their heads .
the horses , being <unk> by the rain , all looked black whether chestnut or bay .
their <unk> , with their wet , close - clinging <unk> , looked strangely thin .
<unk> rose from them .
clothes , saddles , reins , were all wet , <unk> , and <unk> , like the ground and the fallen leaves that <unk> the road .
den'isov 's horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and <unk> his rider 's knee against a tree .
" oh , the devil ! "
exclaimed den'isov angrily , and showing his teeth he struck his horse three times with his whip , splashing himself and his comrades with mud .
" there 'll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today .
on coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the right , den'isov stopped .
" there 's someone coming , " said he .
the <unk> looked in the direction den'isov indicated .
" there are two , an officer and a cossack .
but it is not <unk> that it is the lieutenant colonel himself , " said the <unk> , who was fond of using words the cossacks did not know .
the approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer visible , but they reappeared a few minutes later .
in front , at a weary gallop and using his leather whip , rode an officer , disheveled and <unk> , whose trousers had worked up to above his knees .
behind him , standing in the <unk> , trotted a cossack .
the officer , a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes , galloped up to den'isov and handed him a <unk> envelope .
" from the general , " said the officer . "
please excuse its not being quite dry . "
den'isov , frowning , took the envelope and opened it .
" there , they kept telling us : ' it 's dangerous , it 's dangerous , ' " said the officer , addressing the <unk> while den'isov was reading the dispatch . "
but <unk> and i "- he pointed to the <unk> prepared .
we have each of us two pistols ....
but what 's this ?
" he asked , noticing the french <unk> boy . "
a prisoner ?
you 've already been in action ?
may i speak to him ? "
" wost'ov ! p'etya ! " exclaimed den'isov , having run through the dispatch .
" why did n't you say who you were ? " and turning with a smile he held out his hand to the lad .
the officer was p'etya rost'ov .
all the way p'etya had been preparing himself to behave with den'isov as <unk> a grown - up man and an officer - without <unk> at their previous acquaintance .
" well , i am glad to see you , " den'isov interrupted him , and his face again assumed its anxious expression .
" michael <unk> , " said he to the <unk> , " this is again fwom that german , you know .
he "-
he indicated <unk> serving under him . "
and den'isov told the <unk> that the dispatch just delivered was a <unk> of the german general 's demand that he should join forces with him for an attack on the transport .
" if we do n't take it <unk> , he 'll snatch it fwom under our noses , " he added .
" orders ? "
den'isov repeated thoughtfully . "
but can you stay till <unk> ? "
" oh , please ...
may i stay with you ? "
cried p'etya .
" but , just what did the <unk> tell you ?
to <unk> at once ? " asked den'isov .
p'etya blushed .
" he gave me no instructions .
i think i could ?
" he returned , inquiringly .
" well , all wight , " said den'isov .
den'isov himself intended going with the <unk> and p'etya to the edge of the forest where it reached out to <unk> , to have a look at the part of the french <unk> they were to attack next day .
" well , old fellow , " said he to the peasant guide , " lead us to <unk> . "
den'isov , p'etya , and the <unk> , accompanied by some cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner , rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of the forest .
chapter v
the rain had stopped , and only the mist was falling and drops from the trees .
den'isov , the <unk> , and p'etya
he ascended an incline , stopped , looked about him , and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense .
on reaching a large oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves , he stopped and beckoned <unk> to them with his hand .
den'isov and p'etya rode up to him .
from the spot where the peasant was standing they could see the french .
immediately beyond the forest , on a downward slope , lay a field of spring rye .
to the right , beyond a steep ravine , was a small village and a landowner 's house with a broken roof .
their un - russian shouting at their horses which were straining <unk> with the carts , and their calls to one another , could be clearly heard .
" bwing the prisoner here , " said den'isov in a low voice , not taking his eyes off the french .
a cossack dismounted , lifted the boy down , and took him to den'isov .
pointing to the french troops , den'isov asked him what these and those of them were .
den'isov turned away from him frowning and addressed the <unk> , <unk> his own conjectures to him .
" whether d'olokhov comes or not , we must seize it , eh ? " said den'isov with a merry <unk> in his eyes .
" it is a very suitable spot , " said the <unk> .
" we 'll send the <unk> down by the <unk> , " den'isov continued .
" they 'll <unk> up to the garden ; you 'll wide up fwom there with the cossacks "-
he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the <unk> i with my hussars fwom here .
and at the signal shot ... "
" the hollow is impassable - there 's a <unk> there , " said the <unk> .
" the horses would sink .
we must ride round more to the left .... "
for a moment den'isov and the <unk> drew back .
they were so near that they thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting .
but the firing and shouting did not relate to them .
down below , a man wearing something red was running through the <unk> .
the french were evidently firing and shouting at him .
" why , that 's our t'ikhon , " said the <unk> .
" so it is !
it is ! "
" the <unk> ! " said den'isov .
" he 'll get away ! " said the <unk> , screwing up his eyes .
the french who had been pursuing him stopped .
" smart , that ! " said the <unk> .
" what a beast ! " said den'isov with his former look of vexation .
" what has he been doing all this time ? "
" who is he ? " asked p'etya .
" he 's our <unk> .
i sent him to capture a ' tongue . ' "
" oh , yes , " said p'etya , nodding at the first words den'isov uttered as if he understood it all , though he really did not understand anything of it .
t'ikhon <unk> was one of the most <unk> men in their band .
he was a peasant from <unk> , near the river <unk> .
" we do n't do the french any harm , " said t'ikhon , evidently frightened by den'isov 's words .
" we only <unk> about with the lads for fun , you know !
we killed a score or so of ' more - <unk> , ' but we did no harm else .... "
next day when den'isov had left <unk> , having quite forgotten about this peasant , it was reported to him that t'ikhon had attached himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it .
den'isov gave orders to let him do so .
t'ikhon , who at first did rough work , laying campfires , fetching water , <unk> dead horses , and so on , soon showed a great liking and aptitude for <unk> warfare .
at night he would go out for <unk> and always brought back french clothing and weapons , and when told to would bring in french <unk> also .
den'isov then relieved him from <unk> and began taking him with him when he went out on <unk> and had him enrolled among the cossacks .
t'ikhon did not like riding , and always went on foot , never lagging behind the cavalry .
t'ikhon with equal accuracy would <unk> logs with blows at arm 's length , or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in den'isov 's party he held a peculiar and exceptional position .
" it wo n't hurt that devil - he 's as strong as a horse ! "
they said of him .
once a frenchman t'ikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back .
that wound ( which t'ikhon treated only with internal and external <unk> of vodka ) was the subject of the <unk> jokes by the whole detachment - jokes in which t'ikhon readily joined .
" <unk> , mate !
never again ?
gave you a <unk> ? "
the cossacks would <unk> him .
and t'ikhon , purposely <unk> and making faces , pretended to be angry and swore at the french with the <unk> curses .
the only effect of this incident on t'ikhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners .
he was the bravest and most useful man in the party .
no one found more opportunities for attacking , no one captured or killed more frenchmen , and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role .
now he had been sent by den'isov <unk> to <unk> to capture a " tongue . "
chapter vi
" now , my lad , we 'll go and get <unk> , " he said to p'etya .
as they approached the <unk> den'isov stopped , peering into the forest .
among the trees a man with long legs and long , swinging arms , wearing a short jacket , bast shoes , and a kaz'an hat , was approaching with long , light steps .
he had a <unk> over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his <unk> .
when he <unk> den'isov he hastily threw something into the bushes , removed his <unk> hat by its <unk> <unk> , and approached his commander .
it was t'ikhon .
his wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with self - satisfied merriment .
he lifted his head high and gazed at den'isov as if repressing a laugh .
" well , where did you <unk> to ? " inquired den'isov .
" where did i <unk> to ?
i went to get frenchmen , " answered t'ikhon boldly and hurriedly , in a <unk> but <unk> bass voice .
" why did you push yourself in there by daylight ?
you <unk> !
well , why have n't you taken one ? "
" oh , i took one all right , " said t'ikhon .
" where is he ? "
" you see , i took him first thing at dawn , " t'ikhon continued , spreading out his flat feet with <unk> toes in their bast shoes .
" i took him into the forest .
then i see he 's no good and think i 'll go and fetch a <unk> one . "
" you see ? ...
what a <unk> - it 's just as i thought , " said den'isov to the <unk> .
" why did n't you bwing that one ? "
" what was the good of bringing him ? "
t'ikhon interrupted hastily and <unk> one would n't have done for you .
as if i do n't know what sort you want ! "
" what a <unk> you are ! ...
well ? "
" i went for another one , " t'ikhon continued , " and i crept like this through the wood and lay down . "
( he suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it . )
" one turned up and i <unk> him , like this . "
( he jumped up quickly and lightly . )
" ' come along to the colonel , ' i said .
he starts yelling , and suddenly there were four of them .
they rushed at me with their little swords .
so i went for them with my ax , this way : '
what are you up to ? ' says <unk> ' christ be with you ! '
" shouted t'ikhon , waving his arms with an angry <unk> and throwing out his chest .
" yes , we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the <unk> ! " said the <unk> , screwing up his glittering eyes .
p'etya badly wanted to laugh , but noticed that they all refrained from laughing .
he turned his eyes rapidly from t'ikhon 's face to the <unk> 's and den'isov 's , unable to make out what it all meant .
" do n't play the fool ! " said den'isov , coughing angrily . "
why did n't you bwing the first one ? "
den'isov smiled , and p'etya burst into a <unk> of merry laughter in which t'ikhon himself joined .
" oh , but he was a regular good - for - nothing , " said t'ikhon .
" the clothes on him - poor stuff !
how could i bring him ?
and so rude , your honor !
why , he says : ' i 'm a general 's son myself , i wo n't go ! '
he says . "
" you are a <unk> ! " said den'isov .
" i wanted to question ... "
" but i questioned him , " said t'ikhon .
" he said he did n't know much . '
there are a lot of us , ' he says , ' but all poor stuff - only soldiers in name , ' he says . '
shout loud at them , ' he says , ' and you 'll take them all , ' " t'ikhon concluded , looking cheerfully and resolutely into den'isov 's eyes .
" i 'll give you a <unk> sharp lashes - <unk> teach you to play the fool ! " said den'isov severely .
" but why are you angry ? " <unk> t'ikhon , " just as if i 'd never seen your frenchmen !
only wait till it gets dark and i 'll fetch you any of them
you want - three if you like . "
" well , let 's go , " said den'isov , and rode all the way to the <unk> in silence and frowning angrily .
t'ikhon followed behind and p'etya heard the cossacks laughing with him and at him , about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes .
when the fit of laughter that had seized him at t'ikhon 's words and smile had passed and p'etya realized for a moment that this t'ikhon had killed a man , he felt uneasy .
he looked round at the captive <unk> boy and felt a <unk> in his heart .
but this uneasiness lasted only a moment .
the officer who had been sent to inquire met den'isov on the way with the news that d'olokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him .
den'isov at once cheered up and , calling p'etya to him , said : " well , tell me about yourself . "
chapter vii
p'etya , having left his people after their departure from moscow , joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a large <unk> detachment .
and he was always in a hurry to get where he was not .
when on the twenty - first of october his general expressed a wish to send somebody to den'isov 's detachment , p'etya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse .
so now the general <unk> <unk> his taking part in any action whatever of den'isov 's .
that was why p'etya had blushed and grown confused when den'isov asked him whether he could stay .
before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest p'etya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once .
it was already growing dusk when den'isov , p'etya , and the <unk> rode up to the <unk> .
in the passage of the small <unk> a cossack with sleeves rolled up was <unk> some <unk> .
in the room three officers of den'isov 's band were <unk> a door into a <unk> .
p'etya took off his wet clothes , gave them to be dried , and at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner table .
in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it .
on the table were vodka , a flask of rum , white bread , roast <unk> , and salt .
" so then what do you think , vas'ili dm'itrich ? " said he to den'isov .
" it 's all right my staying a day with you ? "
and not waiting for a reply he answered his own question : " you see i was told to find out
- well , i am finding out ....
only do let me into the very ... into the chief ...
i do n't want a reward ....
but i want ... "
p'etya <unk> his teeth and looked around , throwing back his head and flourishing his arms .
" into the vewy chief ... " den'isov repeated with a smile .
" only , please let me command something , so that i may really command ... " p'etya went on .
" what would it be to you ? ...
oh , you want a knife ? "
he said , turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of <unk> .
and he handed him his <unk> knife .
the officer admired it .
" please keep it .
i have several like it , " said p'etya , blushing . "
heavens !
i was quite forgetting ! "
he suddenly cried .
" i have some <unk> , fine ones ; you know , <unk> ones .
we have a new sutler and he has such capital things .
i bought ten <unk> .
i am used to something sweet .
would you like some ? ... " and p'etya ran out into the passage to his cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five <unk> of <unk> . "
have some , gentlemen , have some ! "
" you want a <unk> , do n't you ?
" he asked the <unk> .
" i bought a capital one from our sutler !
he has splendid things .
and he 's very honest , that 's the chief thing .
i 'll be sure to send it to you .
or perhaps your <unk> are giving out , or are worn out - that happens sometimes , you know .
i have brought some with me , here they are "- and he showed a <unk> hundred <unk> .
i bought them very <unk> .
please take as many as you want , or all if you like .... "
then suddenly , dismayed lest he had said too much , p'etya stopped and blushed .
he tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish .
and running over the events of the day he remembered the french <unk> boy .
" it 's capital for us here , but what of him ?
where have they put him ?
have they fed him ?
have n't they hurt his feelings ?
" he thought .
but having caught himself saying too much about the <unk> , he was now afraid to speak out .
" i might ask , " he thought , " but they 'll say : ' he 's a boy himself and so he <unk> the boy . '
i 'll show them tomorrow whether i 'm a boy .
will it seem <unk> if i ask ? "
p'etya thought .
" well , never mind ! " and immediately , blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical , he said :
" may i call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat ? ...
perhaps ... "
" yes , he 's a poor little fellow , " said den'isov , who evidently saw nothing shameful in this <unk> .
" call him in .
his name is <unk> <unk> .
have him fetched . "
" i 'll call him , " said p'etya .
" yes , yes , call him .
a poor little fellow , " den'isov repeated .
p'etya was standing at the door when den'isov said this .
he slipped in between the officers , came close to den'isov , and said :
" let me kiss you , dear old fellow !
oh , how fine , how splendid ! "
and having kissed den'isov he ran out of the hut .
" <unk> !
<unk> ! "
p'etya cried , stopping outside the door .
" who do you want , sir ? " asked a voice in the darkness .
p'etya replied that he wanted the french lad who had been captured that day .
" ah , <unk> ? " said a cossack .
<unk> , the boy 's name , had already been changed by the cossacks into <unk> ( <unk> ) and into <unk> by the peasants and soldiers .
in both these <unk> the reference to spring ( <unk> ) <unk> the impression made by the young lad .
" he is <unk> himself there by the bonfire .
ho , <unk> !
<unk> ! " laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness .
" he 's a smart lad , " said an hussar standing near p'etya .
" we gave him something to eat a while ago .
he was awfully hungry ! "
the sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the darkness , and the <unk> boy came to the door .
" ah , c'est vous ! " said p'etya .
" <unk> - vous <unk> ?
<unk> pas <unk> , on ne vous fera pas de <unk> , " * he added shyly and affectionately , touching the boy 's hand . "
<unk> , <unk> . "
* ( 2 )
* " ah , it 's you !
do you want something to eat ?
do n't be afraid , they wo n't hurt you . "
* ( 2 ) " come in , come in . "
" merci , monsieur , " * said the <unk> boy in a trembling almost childish voice , and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold .
* " thank you , sir . "
there were many things p'etya wanted to say to the <unk> boy , but did not dare to .
he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage .
then in the darkness he took the boy 's hand and pressed it .
" come in , come in ! "
he repeated in a gentle whisper . "
oh , what can i do for him ? "
he thought , and opening the door he let the boy pass in first .
when the boy had entered the hut , p'etya sat down at a distance from him , considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him .
but he <unk> the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the <unk> boy .
chapter viii
d'olokhov 's appearance amazed p'etya by its simplicity .
den'isov wore a cossack coat , had a beard , had an icon of nicholas the wonder - <unk> on his breast , and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated his unusual position .
but d'olokhov , who in moscow had worn a persian costume , had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the guards .
he was clean - shaven and wore a guardsman 's <unk> coat with an order of st. george at his <unk> and a plain forage cap set straight on his head .
he took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room , and without greeting anyone went up to den'isov and began questioning him about the matter in hand .
den'isov told him of the designs the large <unk> had on the transport , of the message p'etya had brought , and his own replies to both generals .
then he told him all he knew of the french detachment .
" that 's so .
but we must know what troops they are and their numbers , " said d'olokhov .
" it will be necessary to go there .
we ca n't start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are .
i like to work <unk> .
here now - <unk> one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the french camp with me ?
i have brought a spare uniform . "
" i , i ...
i 'll go with you ! "
cried p'etya .
" there 's no need for you to go at all , " said den'isov , addressing d'olokhov , " and as for him , i wo n't let him go on any account . "
" i like that ! " exclaimed p'etya .
" why should n't i go ? "
" because it 's useless . "
" well , you must excuse me , because ... because ... i shall go , and that 's all .
you 'll take me , wo n't you ?
" he said , turning to d'olokhov .
" why not ? " d'olokhov answered absently , scrutinizing the face of the french <unk> boy . "
have you had that <unk> with you long ?
" he asked den'isov .
" he was taken today but he knows nothing .
i 'm keeping him with me . "
" yes , and where do you put the others ? " inquired d'olokhov .
" where ? i send them away and take a <unk> for them , " shouted den'isov , suddenly flushing . "
and i say boldly that i have not a single man 's life on my conscience .
would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee <unk> men to town under escort , instead of <unk> - i speak <unk> - <unk> the honor of a soldier ? "
" that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen , " said d'olokhov with cold irony , " but it 's time for you to drop it . "
" why , i 've not said anything !
i only say that i 'll certainly go with you , " said p'etya shyly .
" but for you and me , old fellow , it 's time to drop these <unk> , " continued d'olokhov , as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated den'isov . "
now , why have you kept this lad ? "
he went on , swaying his head . "
because you are sorry for him !
do n't we know those ' <unk> ' of yours ?
you send a hundred men away , and thirty get there .
the rest either <unk> or get killed .
so is n't it all the same not to send them ? "
the <unk> , screwing up his light - colored eyes , nodded approvingly .
" that 's not the point .
i 'm not going to discuss the matter .
i do not wish to take it on my conscience .
you say they 'll die .
all wight .
only not by my fault ! "
d'olokhov began laughing .
" who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over ?
but if they did catch me they 'd string me up to an <unk> tree , and with all your chivalry just the same . "
he paused . "
however , we must get to work .
tell the cossack to fetch my <unk> .
i have two french uniforms in it .
well , are you coming with me ?
" he asked p'etya .
" i ?
yes , yes , certainly ! "
cried p'etya , blushing almost to tears and glancing at den'isov .
while d'olokhov had been disputing with den'isov what should be done with prisoners , p'etya had once more felt awkward and restless ; but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about .
" if grown - up , distinguished men think so , it must be necessary and right , " thought he . "
but above all den'isov must not dare to imagine that i 'll obey him and that he can order me about .
i will certainly go to the french camp with d'olokhov .
if he can , so can i ! "
and to all den'isov 's <unk> , p'etya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything <unk> and not just anyhow , and that he never considered personal danger .
" for you 'll admit that if we do n't know for sure how many of them there are ... hundreds of lives may depend on it , while there are only two of us .
besides , i want to go very much and certainly will go , so do n't hinder me , " said he .
" it will only make things worse .... "
chapter ix
having put on french greatcoats and shakos , p'etya and d'olokhov rode to the clearing from which den'isov had <unk> the french camp , and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow .
on reaching the bottom , d'olokhov told the cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge .
p'etya , his heart in his mouth with excitement , rode by his side .
" if we 're caught , i wo n't be taken alive !
i have a pistol , " whispered he .
" do n't talk russian , " said d'olokhov in a hurried whisper , and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge : " qui vive ?
"
* and the click of a musket .
* " who goes there ? "
the blood rushed to p'etya 's face and he grasped his pistol .
" <unk> du <unk> , " * replied d'olokhov , neither hastening nor slackening his horse 's pace .
* " <unk> of the <unk> regiment . "
the black figure of a <unk> stood on the bridge .
" mot <unk> . " *
* " password . "
d'olokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk .
" dites <unk> , le colonel <unk> est <unk> ? "
* he asked .
* " tell me , is colonel <unk> here ? "
" mot <unk> , " repeated the <unk> , <unk> the way and not replying .
" quand un <unk> fait sa <unk> , les <unk> ne <unk> pas le mot <unk> ... " cried d'olokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the <unk> . "
je vous <unk> si le colonel est <unk> . "
*
* " when an officer is making his round , sentinels do n't ask him for the password ....
i am asking you if the colonel is here . "
and without waiting for an answer from the <unk> , who had stepped aside , d'olokhov rode up the incline at a walk .
noticing the black <unk> of a man crossing the road , d'olokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were .
having ridden up the road , on both sides of which french talk could be heard around the campfires , d'olokhov turned into the courtyard of the landowner 's house .
having ridden in , he dismounted and approached a big <unk> campfire , around which sat several men talking noisily .
" oh , he 's a hard <unk> to crack , " said one of the officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire .
" he 'll make them get a move on , those fellows ! " said another , laughing .
both fell silent , peering out through the darkness at the sound of d'olokhov 's and p'etya 's steps as they advanced to the fire leading their horses .
" bonjour , <unk> ! "
* said d'olokhov loudly and clearly .
* " good day , gentlemen . "
there was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire , and one tall , long - <unk> officer , walking round the fire , came up to d'olokhov .
" is that you , <unk> ? " he asked .
"
where the devil ... ?
" but , noticing his mistake , he broke off short and , with a frown , greeted d'olokhov as a stranger , asking what he could do for him .
d'olokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their regiment , and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything of the <unk> regiment .
none of them knew anything , and p'etya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and d'olokhov with hostility and suspicion .
for some seconds all were silent .
" if you were counting on the evening soup , you have come too late , " said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh .
d'olokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that night .
he handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck .
that officer did not take his eyes from d'olokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged .
" those brigands are everywhere , " replied an officer from behind the fire .
d'olokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to <unk> such as his companion and himself , " but probably they would not dare to attack large <unk> ?
" he added inquiringly .
no one replied .
" well , now he 'll come away , " p'etya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk .
but d'olokhov <unk> the conversation which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion , how many battalions , and how many prisoners .
asking about the russian prisoners with that detachment , d'olokhov said :
" a horrid business dragging these corpses about with one !
it would be better to shoot such rabble , " and burst into loud laughter , so strange that p'etya thought the french would immediately <unk> their <unk> , and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire .
no one replied a word to d'olokhov 's laughter , and a french officer whom they could not see ( he lay wrapped in a greatcoat ) rose and whispered something to a companion .
d'olokhov got up and called to the soldier who was holding their horses .
" will they bring our horses or not ? " thought p'etya , instinctively drawing nearer to d'olokhov .
the horses were brought .
" good evening , gentlemen , " said d'olokhov .
p'etya wished to say " good night " but could not utter a word .
the officers were whispering together .
d'olokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still , then he rode out of the yard at a footpace .
p'etya rode beside him , longing to look round to see whether or not the french were running after them , but not daring to .
coming out onto the road d'olokhov did not ride back across the open country , but through the village .
at one spot he stopped and listened . "
do you hear ?
" he asked .
p'etya recognized the sound of russian voices and saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round their campfires .
when they had descended to the bridge p'etya and d'olokhov rode past the <unk> , who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it , then they descended into the hollow where the cossacks awaited them .
" well now , good - by .
tell den'isov , ' at the first shot at daybreak , ' " said d'olokhov and was about to ride away , but p'etya seized hold of him .
" really ! " he cried , " you are such a hero !
oh , how fine , how splendid !
how i love you ! "
" all right , all right ! "
said d'olokhov .
but p'etya did not let go of him and d'olokhov saw through the gloom that p'etya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him .
d'olokhov kissed him , laughed , turned his horse , and vanished into the darkness .
chapter x
having returned to the <unk> 's hut , p'etya found den'isov in the passage .
he was awaiting p'etya 's return in a state of agitation , anxiety , and self - reproach for having let him go .
" thank god ! "
he exclaimed . "
yes , thank god ! "
he repeated , listening to p'etya 's rapturous account . "
but , devil take you , i have n't slept because of you !
well , thank god .
now lie down .
we can still get a nap before morning . "
" but ... no , " said p'etya , " i do n't want to sleep yet .
besides i know myself , if i fall asleep it 's finished .
and then i am used to not sleeping before a battle . "
he sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day .
then , noticing that den'isov was asleep , he rose and went out of doors .
it was still quite dark outside .
the rain was over , but drops were still falling from the trees .
near the <unk> 's hut the black <unk> of the cossacks ' <unk> and of horses <unk> together could be seen .
behind the hut the dark <unk> of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible , and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red .
not all the cossacks and hussars were asleep ; here and there , amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by , could be heard low voices which seemed to be whispering .
p'etya came out , <unk> into the darkness , and went up to the wagons .
someone was <unk> under them , and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats .
in the dark p'etya recognized his own horse , which he called " <unk> " though it was of <unk> <unk> , and went up to it .
" well , <unk> !
we 'll do some service tomorrow , " said he , sniffing its <unk> and kissing it .
" why are n't you asleep , sir ? " said a cossack who was sitting under a wagon .
" no , ah ...
<unk> - isn't
that your name ?
do you know i have only just come back !
we 've been into the french camp . "
and p'etya gave the cossack a <unk> account not only of his ride but also of his object , and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act " just anyhow . "
" well , you should get some sleep now , " said the cossack .
" no , i am used to this , " said p'etya .
" i say , are n't the <unk> in your pistols worn out ?
i brought some with me .
do n't you want any ?
you can have some . "
the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at p'etya .
" because i am accustomed to doing everything <unk> , " said p'etya .
" some fellows do things just anyhow , without preparation , and then they 're sorry for it afterwards .
i do n't like that . "
" just so , " said the cossack .
" oh yes , another thing !
please , my dear fellow , will you <unk> my saber for me ?
it 's got <unk> ... "
( p'etya feared to tell a lie , and the saber never had been <unk> . )
" can you do it ? "
" of course i can . "
<unk> got up , <unk> in his pack , and soon p'etya heard the <unk> sound of steel on <unk> .
he climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge .
the cossack was <unk> the saber under the wagon .
" i say !
are the lads asleep ? " asked p'etya .
" some are , and some <unk> - like us . "
" well , and that boy ? "
" <unk> ?
oh , he 's thrown himself down there in the passage .
fast asleep after his fright .
he was that glad ! "
after that p'etya remained silent for a long time , listening to the sounds .
he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared .
" what are you <unk> ? " asked a man coming up to the wagon .
" why , this gentleman 's saber . "
" that 's right , " said the man , whom p'etya took to be an hussar .
" was the cup left here ? "
" there , by the wheel ! "
the hussar took the cup .
" it must be daylight soon , " said he , <unk> , and went away .
he was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality .
the big dark <unk> might really be the <unk> 's hut or it might be a <unk> leading to the very depths of the earth .
perhaps the red spot was a fire , or it might be the eye of an enormous monster .
it might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow , but perhaps he had simply vanished - disappeared altogether and <unk> into <unk> .
nothing p'etya could have seen now would have surprised him .
he was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible .
he looked up at the sky .
and the sky was a fairy realm like the earth .
it was clearing , and over the <unk> of the trees clouds were swiftly <unk> as if <unk> the stars .
sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing , and a clear black sky appeared .
sometimes it seemed as if the black <unk> were clouds .
sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high , high <unk> , and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with one 's hand .
p'etya 's eyes began to close and he swayed a little .
the trees were dripping .
quiet talking was heard .
the horses <unk> and jostled one another .
someone <unk> .
" <unk> - <unk> , <unk> - <unk> ... " hissed the saber against the <unk> , and suddenly p'etya heard an <unk> orchestra playing some unknown , sweetly solemn <unk> .
p'etya was as musical as nat'asha and more so than nicholas , but had never learned music or thought about it , and so the <unk> that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive .
the music became more and more audible .
the <unk> grew and passed from one instrument to another .
and what was played was a <unk> - though p'etya had not the least conception of what a <unk> is .
" oh - why , that was in a dream ! "
p'etya said to himself , as he <unk> forward .
" it 's in my ears .
but perhaps it 's music of my own .
well , go on , my music !
now ! ... "
he closed his eyes , and , from all sides as if from a distance , sounds fluttered , grew into <unk> , separated , <unk> , and again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn <unk> . "
oh , this is delightful !
as much as i like and as i like ! " said p'etya to himself .
he tried to conduct that enormous orchestra .
" now softly , softly die away ! " and the sounds obeyed him . "
now <unk> , more joyful .
still more and more joyful ! "
and from an unknown depth rose <unk> triumphant sounds .
" now voices join in ! " ordered p'etya .
and at first from <unk> he heard men 's voices and
then women 's .
the voices grew in <unk> triumphant strength , and p'etya listened to their <unk> beauty in awe and joy .
p'etya did not know how long this lasted : he enjoyed himself all the time , wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it .
he was awakened by <unk> 's kindly voice .
" it 's ready , your honor ; you can <unk> a frenchman in half with it ! "
p'etya woke up .
" it 's getting light , it 's really getting light ! " he exclaimed .
the horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their very <unk> , and a <unk> light showed itself through the bare branches .
p'etya shook himself , jumped up , took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to <unk> ; then he <unk> the saber , <unk> it , and <unk> it .
the cossacks were <unk> their horses and <unk> their saddle <unk> .
" and here 's the commander , " said <unk> .
den'isov came out of the <unk> 's hut and , having called p'etya , gave orders to get ready .
chapter xi
the men rapidly picked out their horses in the <unk> , <unk> their saddle <unk> , and formed companies .
den'isov stood by the <unk> 's hut giving final orders .
the infantry of the detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn , hundreds of feet splashing through the mud .
the <unk> gave some orders to his men .
p'etya held his horse by the bridle , impatiently awaiting the order to mount .
his face , having been bathed in cold water , was all <unk> , and his eyes were particularly brilliant .
cold <unk> ran down his spine and his whole body <unk> rhythmically .
" well , is <unk> <unk> ? " asked den'isov . "
bwing the horses . "
the horses were brought .
den'isov was angry with the cossack because the saddle <unk> were too <unk> , <unk> him , and mounted .
p'etya put his foot in the stirrup .
" vas'ili dm'itrich , <unk> me with some commission !
please ... for god 's sake ... ! " said he .
den'isov seemed to have forgotten p'etya 's very existence .
he turned to glance at him .
" i ask one thing of you , " he said sternly , " to obey me and not shove yourself forward anywhere . "
he did not say another word to p'etya but rode in silence all the way .
when they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field .
den'isov talked in whispers with the <unk> and the cossacks rode past p'etya and den'isov .
when they had all ridden by , den'isov touched his horse and rode down the hill .
slipping onto their <unk> and <unk> , the horses descended with their riders into the ravine .
p'etya rode beside den'isov , the <unk> of his body constantly increasing .
it was getting lighter and lighter , but the mist still hid distant <unk> .
having reached the valley , den'isov looked back and nodded to a cossack beside him .
" the signal ! " said he .
the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out .
in an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard , shouts came from various sides , and then more shots .
at the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting , p'etya <unk> his horse and <unk> his rein galloped forward , not heeding den'isov who shouted at him .
it seemed to p'etya that at the moment the shot was fired it suddenly became as bright as noon .
he galloped to the bridge .
cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him .
on the bridge he <unk> with a cossack who had fallen behind , but he galloped on .
in front of him soldiers , probably frenchmen , were running from right to left across the road .
one of them fell in the mud under his horse 's feet .
cossacks were crowding about a hut , busy with something .
from the midst of that crowd terrible screams arose .
p'etya galloped up , and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman , clutching the handle of a <unk> that had been aimed at him .
" hurrah ! ...
lads ! ...
ours ! " shouted p'etya , and giving rein to his excited horse he galloped forward along the village street .
he could hear shooting ahead of him .
cossacks , hussars , and <unk> russian prisoners , who had come running from both sides of the road , were shouting something loudly and incoherently .
a gallant - looking frenchman , in a blue overcoat , <unk> , and with a frowning red face , had been defending himself against the hussars .
when p'etya galloped up the frenchman had already fallen . "
too late again ! " flashed through p'etya 's mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard .
the shots came from the yard of the landowner 's house he had visited the night before with d'olokhov .
the french were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden <unk> <unk> with bushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the gateway .
through the smoke , as he approached the gate , p'etya saw d'olokhov , whose face was of a pale - <unk> <unk> , shouting to his men . "
go round !
wait for the infantry !
" he exclaimed as p'etya rode up to him .
" wait ? ...
hurrah - ah - ah ! " shouted p'etya , and without pausing a moment galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the smoke was <unk> .
a <unk> was heard , and some bullets whistled past , while others <unk> against something .
the cossacks and d'olokhov galloped after p'etya into the gateway of the courtyard .
in the dense wavering smoke some of the french threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the cossacks , while others ran down the hill toward the pond .
p'etya was galloping along the courtyard , but instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and strangely , slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle .
his horse , having galloped up to a campfire that was <unk> in the morning light , stopped suddenly , and p'etya fell heavily on to the wet ground .
the cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless .
a bullet had <unk> his skull .
" done for ! " he said with a frown , and went to the gate to meet den'isov who was riding toward him .
" killed ? "
cried den'isov , recognizing from a distance the <unk> lifeless attitude - very familiar to him - in which p'etya 's body was lying .
" done for ! " repeated d'olokhov as if the <unk> of these words afforded him pleasure , and he went quickly up to the prisoners , who were surrounded by cossacks who had hurried up .
" we wo n't take them ! "
he called out to den'isov .
den'isov did not reply ; he rode up to p'etya , dismounted , and with trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained , mud - <unk> face which had already gone white .
" i am used to something sweet .
<unk> , fine ones ... take them all ! "
he recalled p'etya 's words .
and the cossacks looked round in surprise at the sound , like the <unk> of a dog , with which den'isov turned away , walked to the wattle fence , and seized hold of it .
among the russian prisoners rescued by den'isov and d'olokhov was pierre bez'ukhov .
chapter xii
during the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was pierre .
on the twenty - second of october that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage <unk> with which it had left moscow .
half the wagons laden with <unk> that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured by cossacks , the other half had gone on ahead .
not one of those dismounted <unk> who had marched in front of the prisoners was left ; they had all disappeared .
the artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced by marshal <unk> 's enormous baggage train , <unk> by <unk> .
behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train .
from vy'azma <unk> the french army , which had till then moved in three columns , went on as a single group .
the symptoms of disorder that pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had now reached the utmost limit .
the road along which they moved was <unk> on both sides by dead horses ; <unk> men who had fallen behind from various regiments continually changed about , now joining the moving column , now again lagging behind it .
these three groups traveling together - the cavalry stores , the convoy of prisoners , and <unk> 's baggage train - still constituted a separate and united whole , though each of the groups was rapidly <unk> away .
of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons , not more than sixty now remained ; the rest had been captured or left behind .
some of <unk> 's wagons also had been captured or abandoned .
three wagons had been <unk> and <unk> by <unk> from davout 's corps .
the group of prisoners had melted away most of all .
of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from moscow <unk> than a hundred now remained .
the prisoners were more <unk> to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or <unk> 's baggage .
the arrangement adopted when they started , that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest , had long since been abandoned .
all who could walk went together , and after the third stage pierre had rejoined karat'aev and the gray - blue <unk> - legged dog that had chosen karat'aev for its master .
on the third day after leaving moscow karat'aev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow , and as he grew gradually weaker pierre kept away from him .
pierre did not know why , but since karat'aev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him .
and now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new , <unk> truth - that nothing in this world is terrible .
he had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free , so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom .
of all that he himself subsequently termed his sufferings , but which at the time he scarcely felt , the worst was the state of his bare , <unk> , and <unk> - covered feet .
the one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet .
however , he did not look at them now , but thought of other things .
he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who <unk> behind , though more than a hundred perished in that way .
he did not think of karat'aev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to share that fate .
still less did pierre think about himself .
the harder his position became and the more terrible the future , the more independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts , memories , and <unk> that came to him .
chapter xiii
at midday on the twenty - second of october pierre was going <unk> along the muddy , <unk> road , looking at his feet and at the <unk> of the way .
occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet .
the former and the latter were alike familiar and his own .
the dog was merrier and <unk> than it had been in moscow .
all around lay the flesh of different animals - from men to horses - in various stages of <unk> ; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted .
it had been <unk> since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear , but after a short break it began <unk> harder than before .
the <unk> road no longer absorbed the water , which ran along the <unk> in <unk> .
pierre walked along , looking from side to side , counting his steps in threes , and reckoning them off on his fingers .
mentally addressing the rain , he repeated : " now then , now then , go on !
<unk> harder ! "
it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing , but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting .
this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with karat'aev the day before .
at their yesterday 's halting place , feeling <unk> by a dying campfire , pierre had got up and gone to the next one , which was burning better .
there plat'on karat'aev was sitting covered up - head and all - with his greatcoat as if it were a <unk> , telling the soldiers in his <unk> and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew .
it was already past midnight , the hour when karat'aev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively .
when pierre reached the fire and heard plat'on 's voice <unk> by illness , and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the <unk> , he felt a painful <unk> at his heart .
his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away , but there was no other fire , and pierre sat down , trying not to look at plat'on .
" well , how are you ? " he asked .
" how am i ?
if we <unk> at sickness , god wo n't grant us death , " replied plat'on , and at once resumed the story he had begun .
" and so , brother , " he continued , with a smile on his pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes , " you see , brother ... "
pierre had long been familiar with that story .
karat'aev had told it to him alone some half - dozen times and always with a specially joyful emotion .
but well as he knew it , pierre now listened to that tale as to something new , and the quiet rapture karat'aev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to pierre .
the story was of an old merchant who lived a good and god - fearing life with his family , and who went once to the n'izhni fair with a companion - a rich merchant .
having put up at an inn they both went to sleep , and next morning his companion was found <unk> and with his throat cut .
a bloodstained knife was found under the old merchant 's pillow .
he was tried , <unk> , and his <unk> having been torn off , " all in due form " as karat'aev put it , he was sent to hard labor in siberia .
" and so , brother " ( it was at this point that pierre came up ) , " ten years or more passed by .
the old man was living as a <unk> , submitting as he should and doing no wrong .
only he prayed to god for death .
well , one night the convicts were gathered just as we are , with the old man among them .
and they began telling what each was suffering for , and how they had <unk> against god .
one told how he had taken a life , another had taken two , a third had set a house on fire , while another had simply been a <unk> and had done nothing .
so they asked the old man : ' what are you being punished for , <unk> , my dear brothers , ' said he , ' am being punished for my own and other men 's sins .
but i have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine , but have only helped my poorer brothers .
i was a merchant , my dear brothers , and had much property . '
and he went on to tell them all about it in due order . '
i do n't grieve for myself , ' he says , ' god , it seems , has <unk> me .
only i am sorry for my old wife and the children , ' and the old man began to weep .
now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant . '
where did it happen , <unk> ? '
he said . '
when , and in what month ? '
he asked all about it and his heart began to <unk> .
so he comes up to the old man like this , and falls down at his feet ! '
you are <unk> because of me , <unk> , ' he says .
' it 's quite true , lads , that this man , ' he says , ' is being tortured <unk> and for nothing !
i , ' he says , ' did that deed , and i put the knife under your head while you were asleep .
forgive me , <unk> , ' he says , ' for christ 's sake ! ' "
karat'aev paused , smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire , and he drew the logs together .
" and the old man said , ' god will forgive you , we are all <unk> in his sight .
i suffer for my own sins , ' and he wept bitter tears .
well , and what do you think , dear friends ? "
that murderer confessed to the authorities . '
i have taken six lives , ' he says ( he was a great sinner ) , ' but what i am most sorry for is this old man .
do n't let him suffer because of me . '
so he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form .
the place was a long way off , and while they were judging , what with one thing and another , filling in the papers all in due form - the authorities i mean - time passed .
the affair reached the tsar .
after a while the tsar 's <unk> came : to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been <unk> .
the paper arrived and they began to look for the old man . '
where is the old man who has been suffering <unk> and in vain ?
a paper has come from the tsar ! '
so they began looking for him , " here karat'aev 's lower jaw trembled , " but god had already forgiven him - he was dead !
that 's how it was , dear fellows ! "
karat'aev concluded and sat for a long time silent , gazing before him with a smile .
chapter xiv
" ` a <unk> places ! "
* suddenly cried a voice .
* " to your places . "
a pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners .
from all sides came shouts of command , and from the left came <unk> dressed <unk> on good horses , passing the prisoners at a trot .
the expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach of those in authority .
the prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road .
the convoy formed up .
" the emperor !
the emperor !
the marshal !
the duke ! " and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed , before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by .
pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three - <unk> hat with a tranquil look on his handsome , plump , white face .
it was one of the marshals .
his eye fell on pierre 's large and striking figure , and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought he <unk> sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy .
the general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red and frightened face , <unk> up his <unk> horse .
several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them .
their faces all looked excited and worried .
" what did he say ?
what did he say ?
" pierre heard them ask .
while the marshal was passing , the prisoners had <unk> together in a crowd , and pierre saw karat'aev whom he had not yet seen that morning .
he sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree .
on his face , besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered <unk> , there was now an expression of quiet solemnity .
karat'aev looked at pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with tears , evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to him .
but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself .
he made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away .
when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round .
karat'aev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two frenchmen were talking over his head .
pierre did not look round again but went limping up the hill .
from behind , where karat'aev had been sitting , came the sound of a shot .
pierre heard it plainly , but at that moment he remembered that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to smol'ensk - a <unk> he had begun before the marshal went by .
and he again started reckoning .
two french soldiers ran past pierre , one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun .
they both looked pale , and in the expression on their faces - one of them glanced timidly at pierre - there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution .
pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that , two days before , that man had burned his shirt while <unk> it at the fire and how they had laughed at him .
behind him , where karat'aev had been sitting , the dog began to <unk> .
" what a stupid beast !
why is it <unk> ? " thought pierre .
chapter xv
the stores , the prisoners , and the marshal 's baggage train stopped at the village of <unk> .
the men crowded together round the campfires .
pierre went up to the fire , ate some roast horseflesh , lay down with his back to the fire , and immediately fell asleep .
he again slept as he had done at mozh'aysk after the battle of borodin'o .
again real events mingled with dreams and again someone , he or another , gave expression to his thoughts , and even to the same thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at mozh'aysk .
" life is everything .
life is god .
everything changes and moves and that movement is god .
and while there is life there is joy in consciousness of the divine .
to love life is to love god .
harder and more blessed than all else is to love this life in one 's sufferings , in innocent sufferings . "
" karat'aev ! " came to pierre 's mind .
and suddenly he saw vividly before him a long - forgotten , kindly old man who had given him <unk> lessons in switzerland . "
wait a bit , " said the old man , and showed pierre a <unk> .
this <unk> was alive - a <unk> ball without fixed <unk> .
its whole surface consisted of drops closely pressed together , and all these drops moved and changed places , sometimes several of them merging into one , sometimes one <unk> into many .
each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible , but others striving to do the same compressed it , sometimes destroyed it , and sometimes merged with it .
" that is life , " said the old teacher .
" how simple and clear it is , " thought pierre .
" how is it i did not know it before ? "
" god is in the midst , and each drop <unk> to <unk> so as to reflect him to the greatest extent .
and it <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from the surface , <unk> to the depths , and again <unk> .
there now , karat'aev has spread out and disappeared .
do you understand , my child ? " said the teacher .
" do you understand , <unk> you ? " shouted a voice , and pierre woke up .
he lifted himself and sat up .
a frenchman who had just pushed a russian soldier away was squatting by the fire , engaged in <unk> a piece of meat stuck on a <unk> .
his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy , hairy , red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the <unk> .
his brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the <unk> .
" it 's all the same to him , " he muttered , turning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him . "
<unk> !
get away ! "
and twisting the <unk> he looked gloomily at pierre , who turned away and gazed into the darkness .
a prisoner , the russian soldier the frenchman had pushed away , was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand .
looking more closely pierre recognized the blue - gray dog , sitting beside the soldier , <unk> its tail .
" ah , he 's come ? " said pierre . "
and <unk> "
he began , but did not finish .
before <unk> he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing .
french soldiers were running past him .
" the cossacks ! "
one of them shouted , and a moment later a crowd of russians surrounded pierre .
for a long time he could not understand what was happening to him .
all around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy .
" brothers !
dear fellows !
<unk> ! "
old soldiers exclaimed , weeping , as they embraced cossacks and hussars .
the hussars and cossacks crowded round the prisoners ; one offered them clothes , another boots , and a third bread .
pierre sobbed as he sat among them and could not utter a word .
he hugged the first soldier who approached him , and kissed him , weeping .
d'olokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house , letting a crowd of <unk> frenchmen pass by .
on the opposite side stood d'olokhov 's cossack , counting the prisoners and <unk> off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate .
" how many ? "
d'olokhov asked the cossack .
" the second hundred , " replied the cossack .
" <unk> , <unk> ! "
* d'olokhov kept saying , having adopted this expression from the french , and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they flashed with a cruel light .
* " get along , get along ! "
den'isov , bareheaded and with a gloomy face , walked behind some cossacks who were carrying the body of p'etya rost'ov to a <unk> that had been dug in the garden .
chapter xvi
from this beginning the <unk> terms of the <unk> could be determined <unk> .
beyond vy'azma the french army instead of moving in three columns <unk> together into one mass , and so went on to the end .
berthier wrote to his emperor ( we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to <unk> from the truth in describing the condition of an army ) and this is what he said :
i <unk> it my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the various corps i have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last two or three days ' march .
they are almost <unk> .
scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments , the others go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and escape discipline .
in general they regard smol'ensk as the place where they hope to recover .
during the last few days many of the men have been seen to throw away their <unk> and their arms .
the soldiers , who are worn out with hunger and fatigue , need these supplies as well as a few days ' rest .
many have died these last days on the road or at the <unk> .
this state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under control in case of an engagement .
november <unk> : twenty miles from smol'ensk .
after staggering into smol'ensk which seemed to them a promised land , the french , searching for food , killed one another , <unk> their own stores , and when everything had been plundered fled farther .
they all went without knowing <unk> or why they were going .
still less did that genius , napoleon , know it , for no one issued any orders to him .
and though they pretended to be concerned about the army , each was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself .
chapter xvii
first he rings his bell <unk> , but when he gets into a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can , and often thinking to escape runs straight into his opponent 's arms .
owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit and the <unk> <unk> of the horses , the chief means of <unk> <unk> the enemy 's position - by cavalry <unk> - was not available .
besides , as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each army , even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time .
one army fled and the other pursued .
expecting the enemy from behind and not in front , the french separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty - four hours .
in front of them all fled the emperor , then the kings , then the dukes .
and here as in a game of <unk> 's <unk> the french ran into our vanguard .
seeing their enemy unexpectedly the french fell into confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright , but then they resumed their flight , abandoning their comrades who were farther behind .
they abandoned one another , abandoned all their heavy baggage , their artillery , and half their men , and fled , getting past the russians by night by making <unk> to the right .
from <unk> they fled farther along the road to v'ilna , still playing at <unk> 's <unk> with the pursuing army .
at the <unk> they again became disorganized , many were drowned and many surrendered , but those who got across the river fled farther .
their supreme chief donned a fur coat and , having seated himself in a sleigh , galloped on alone , abandoning his companions .
the others who could do so drove away too , leaving those who could not to surrender or die .
chapter xviii
this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which they did all they could to destroy themselves .
from the time they turned onto the kal'uga road to the day their leader fled from the army , none of the movements of the crowd had any sense .
but no !
<unk> profound considerations are given for his retreat from smol'ensk to <unk> .
then his heroism at <unk> is described , where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command , and to have walked about with a birch stick and said :
" <unk> <unk> fait l'empereur ; il est temps de faire le <unk> , " * but nevertheless immediately ran away again , abandoning to its fate the scattered <unk> of the army he left behind .
* " i have acted the emperor long enough ; it is time to act the general . "
and <unk> , the final departure of the great emperor from his heroic army is presented to us by the historians as something great and characteristic of genius .
even that final running away , described in ordinary <unk> as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is taught to be ashamed of - even that act finds justification in the historians ' <unk> .
" greatness , " it seems , <unk> the standards of right and wrong .
for the " great " man nothing is wrong , there is no <unk> for which a " great " man can be blamed .
" c'est grand ! "
* say the historians , and there no longer exists either good or evil but only " grand " and " not grand . "
grand is good , not grand is bad .
grand is the characteristic , in their conception , of some special animals called " <unk> . "
* " it is great . "
* ( 2 ) that it is great .
" du <unk> ( he saw something <unk> in himself ) au ridicule il <unk> a <unk> pas , " * said he .
and the whole world for fifty years has been repeating : " <unk> !
grand !
napol'eon le grand ! "
du <unk> au ridicule il <unk> a <unk> pas .
* " from the <unk> to the ridiculous is but a step . "
and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not <unk> with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one 's own <unk> and <unk> meanness .
for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ , no human actions are <unk> .
and there is no greatness where simplicity , goodness , and truth are absent .
chapter xix
what russian , reading the account of the last part of the campaign of 1812 , has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret , dissatisfaction , and perplexity ?
can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them ?
how could that happen ?
history ( or what is called by that name ) replying to these questions says that this occurred because kut'uzov and <unk> and <unk> , and this man and that man , did not execute such and such maneuvers ....
but why did they not execute those maneuvers ?
and why if they were guilty of not carrying out a <unk> plan were they not tried and punished ?
why was the russian army - which with <unk> forces had <unk> the enemy in full strength at borodin'o - defeated at <unk> and the <unk> by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was <unk> superior ?
there never was or could have been such an aim , for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible .
it would have been senseless , first because napoleon 's disorganized army was flying from russia with all possible speed , that is to say , was doing just what every russian desired .
so what was the use of performing various <unk> on the french who were running away as fast as they possibly could ?
secondly , it would have been senseless to <unk> the passage of men whose whole energy was directed to flight .
the only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry .
but not even that could be said for those who drew up this project , for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled beds .
but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would have been senseless , it was impossible .
secondly it was impossible , because to <unk> the <unk> with which napoleon 's army was retiring , <unk> greater forces than the russians possessed would have been required .
thirdly it was impossible , because the military term " to cut off " has no meaning .
one can cut off a <unk> of bread , but not an army .
it is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured , just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it <unk> on one 's hand .
men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of <unk> and <unk> , as the germans did .
but the french troops quite rightly did not consider that this suited them , since death by hunger and cold awaited them in flight or <unk> alike .
during the movement of the russian army from <unk> to <unk> it lost fifty thousand sick or <unk> , that is a number equal to the <unk> of a large provincial town .
half the men fell out of the army without a battle .
the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the <unk> of a dozen people .
it could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable .
the people had a single aim : to free their land from invasion .
that aim was attained in the first place of itself , as the french ran away , and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight .
secondly it was attained by the <unk> warfare which was destroying the french , and thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french , ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped .
the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal .
and the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a <unk> than to <unk> the running animal on the head .
book fifteen : 1812 - <unk>
chapter i
when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror : substance similar to his own is <unk> before his eyes .
after prince andrew 's death nat'asha and princess mary alike felt this .
drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of death that <unk> them , they dared not look life in the face .
they carefully <unk> their open wounds from any rough and painful <unk> .
only when alone together were they free from such <unk> and pain .
they spoke little even to one another , and when they did it was of very unimportant matters .
both avoided any <unk> to the future .
to admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult his memory .
still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead .
but pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy .
life did not stand still and it was necessary to live .
she went through the accounts with alp'atych , conferred with dessalles about her nephew , and gave orders and made preparations for the journey to moscow .
nat'asha remained alone and , from the time princess mary began making preparations for departure , held aloof from her too .
" i am not going anywhere , " nat'asha replied when this was proposed to her . "
do please just leave me alone ! "
and she ran out of the room , with difficulty <unk> from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow .
this solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it .
as soon as anyone entered she got up quickly , changed her position and expression , and picked up a book or some <unk> , evidently waiting impatiently for the <unk> to go .
she felt all the time as if she might at any moment <unk> that on which - with a terrible questioning too great for her strength - her spiritual gaze was fixed .
she was gazing in the direction in which he had gone - to the other side of life .
she was gazing where she knew him to be ; but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here .
she now saw him again as he had been at myt'ishchi , at tr'oitsa , and at yarosl'avl .
she saw his face , heard his voice , repeated his words and her own , and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken .
there he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak , leaning his head on his thin pale hand .
his chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised .
his lips are firmly closed , his eyes glitter , and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead .
one of his legs <unk> just perceptibly , but rapidly .
nat'asha knows that he is struggling with terrible pain . "
what is that pain like ?
why does he have that pain ?
what does he feel ?
how does it hurt him ? "
thought nat'asha .
he noticed her watching him , raised his eyes , and began to speak seriously :
" one thing would be terrible , " said he : " to bind oneself forever to a suffering man .
it would be continual torture . "
and he looked <unk> at her .
nat'asha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say .
she said : " this ca n't go on - it wo n't .
you will get well - quite well . "
she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and <unk> what she had then felt .
she recalled his long sad and severe look at those words and understood the meaning of the <unk> and despair in that <unk> gaze .
" i agreed , " nat'asha now said to herself , " that it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer .
i said it then only because it would have been dreadful for him , but he understood it differently .
he thought it would be dreadful for me .
he then still wished to live and feared death .
and i said it so awkwardly and <unk> !
i did not say what i meant .
i thought quite differently .
had i said what i thought
, i should have said : even if he had to go on dying , to die continually before my eyes , i should have been happy compared with what i am now .
now there is nothing ...
nobody .
did he know that ?
no , he did not and never will know it .
and now it will never , never be possible to put it right . "
and now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her , only in her imagination
nat'asha this time gave him a different answer .
she stopped him and said : " terrible for you , but not for me !
and in her imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have said then but only spoke now : " i love thee ! ...
thee !
i love , love ... " she said , convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate effort ....
she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her eyes ; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this .
again everything was <unk> in hard , dry perplexity , and again with a strained frown she <unk> toward the world where he was .
and now , now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery ....
but at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears .
duny'asha , her maid , entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing no <unk> for her mistress .
" come to your papa at once , please ! "
said she with a strange , excited look .
"
a misfortune ... about peter <unk> ... a letter
, " she finished with a sob .
chapter ii
besides a feeling of <unk> from everybody nat'asha was feeling a special estrangement from the members of her own family .
she heard duny'asha 's words about peter <unk> and a misfortune , but did not grasp them .
" what misfortune ?
what misfortune can happen to them ?
they just live their own old , quiet , and <unk> life , " thought nat'asha .
as she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her mother 's room .
his face was puckered up and wet with tears .
he had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking him .
when he saw nat'asha he waved his arms <unk> and burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face .
" <unk> ... p'etya ...
go , go , she ... is calling ... " and weeping like a child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair , he almost fell into it , covering his face with his hands .
suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through nat'asha 's whole being .
terrible <unk> struck her heart , she felt a dreadful <unk> as if something was being torn inside her
and she were dying .
but the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life .
the sight of her father , the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the door , made her immediately forget herself and her own grief .
she ran to her father , but he feebly waved his arm , pointing to her mother 's door .
princess mary , pale and with quivering chin , came out from that room and taking nat'asha by the arm said something to her .
nat'asha neither saw nor heard her .
she went in with rapid steps , pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself , and then ran to her mother .
the countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position , stretching out and beating her head against the wall .
s'onya and the maids were holding her arms .
" nat'asha ! nat'asha ! ... " cried the countess .
" it 's not true ... it 's not true ...
he 's lying ...
nat'asha !
" she shrieked , pushing those around her away . "
go away , all of you ; it 's not true !
killed ! ...
ha , ha , ha ! ...
it 's not true ! "
nat'asha put one knee on the armchair , stooped over her mother , embraced her , and with unexpected strength raised her , turned her face toward herself , and clung to her .
" mummy ! ...
darling ! ...
i am here , my dearest mummy , " she kept on whispering , not pausing an instant .
she did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her , demanded a pillow and hot water , and unfastened and tore open her mother 's dress .
" my dearest darling ...
mummy , my precious ! ...
" she whispered incessantly , kissing her head , her hands , her face , and feeling her own irrepressible and <unk> tears <unk> her nose and cheeks .
the countess pressed her daughter 's hand , closed her eyes , and became quiet for a moment .
suddenly she sat up with <unk> <unk> , glanced <unk> around her , and seeing nat'asha began to press her daughter 's head with all her strength .
then she turned toward her daughter 's face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it .
" nat'asha , you love me ?
" she said in a soft <unk> whisper . "
nat'asha , you would not deceive me ?
you 'll tell me the whole truth ? "
nat'asha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness .
" my darling mummy ! " she repeated , straining all the power of her love to find some way of taking on herself the <unk> of grief that crushed her mother .
and again in a <unk> struggle with reality her mother , refusing to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the <unk> of life , escaped from reality into a world of delirium .
nat'asha did not remember how that day passed nor that night , nor the next day and night .
she did not sleep and did not leave her mother .
her <unk> and patient love seemed completely to <unk> the countess every moment , not explaining or consoling , but recalling her to life .
during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes , and nat'asha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes , but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak .
the countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly .
" how glad i am you have come .
you are tired .
wo n't you have some tea ?
" nat'asha went up to her . "
you have improved in looks and grown more manly , " continued the countess , taking her daughter 's hand .
" mamma !
what are you saying ... "
" nat'asha , he is no more , no more ! "
and embracing her daughter , the countess began to weep for the first time .
chapter iii
princess mary <unk> her departure .
s'onya and the count tried to replace nat'asha but could not .
they saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair .
the mother 's wounded spirit could not <unk> .
p'etya 's death had torn from her half her life .
when the news of p'etya 's death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty , but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life .
but the same blow that almost killed the countess , this second blow , restored nat'asha to life .
nat'asha 's wound <unk> in that way .
she thought her life was ended , but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life - love - was still active within her .
love awoke and so did life .
prince andrew 's last days had bound princess mary and nat'asha together ; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another .
princess mary put off her departure , and for three weeks looked after nat'asha as if she had been a sick child .
the last weeks passed in her mother 's bedroom had strained nat'asha 's physical strength .
one afternoon noticing nat'asha shivering with fever , princess mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed .
nat'asha lay down , but when princess mary had drawn the <unk> and was going away she called her back .
" i do n't want to sleep , mary , sit by me a little . "
" you are tired - try to sleep . "
" no , no .
why did you bring me away ?
she will be asking for me . "
" she is much better .
she spoke so well today , " said princess mary .
nat'asha lay on the bed and in the <unk> of the room scanned princess mary 's face .
" is she like him ? " thought nat'asha . "
yes , like and yet not like .
but she is quite original , strange , new , and unknown .
and she loves me .
what is in her heart ?
all that is good .
but how ?
what is her mind like ?
what does she think about me ?
yes , she is splendid ! "
" mary , " she said timidly , drawing princess mary 's hand to herself , " mary , you must n't think me wicked .
no ?
mary darling , how i love you !
let us be quite , quite friends . "
and nat'asha , embracing her , began kissing her face and hands , making princess mary feel shy but happy by this <unk> of her feelings .
from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between princess mary and nat'asha .
they were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together .
when one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her .
together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone .
a feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them ; an <unk> feeling of life being possible only in each other 's presence .
sometimes they were silent for hours ; sometimes after they were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning .
they spoke most of what was long past .
she did not think of <unk> submission and self - <unk> to her own life , for she was accustomed to seek other joys , but she understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues .
for princess mary , listening to nat'asha 's tales of childhood and early youth , there also opened out a new and hitherto <unk> side of life : belief in life and its enjoyment .
just as before , they never mentioned him so as not to lower ( as they thought )
their <unk> feelings by words ; but this silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being conscious of it .
nat'asha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all talked about her health , and this pleased her .
it seemed to her that things must be so , and yet it was dreadfully sad .
one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath .
unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down , and then , <unk> her strength , ran upstairs again , observing the result .
the wound had begun to <unk> from within .
at the end of january princess mary left for moscow , and the count insisted on nat'asha 's going with her to consult the doctors .
chapter iv
the flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could not keep up with them ; cavalry and artillery horses broke down , and the information received of the movements of the french was never reliable .
the men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of twenty - seven miles a day that they could not go any faster .
the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as <unk> to our army as the flight of the french was to theirs .
the chief cause of the <unk> of napoleon 's army was the rapidity of its movement , and a <unk> proof of this is the <unk> <unk> of the russian army .
but besides this , since the <unk> and enormous <unk> of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident , another reason for slackening the pace and <unk> presented itself to kut'uzov .
the aim of the russian army was to <unk> the french .
the road the french would take was unknown , and so the closer our troops <unk> on their heels the greater distance they had to cover .
only by following at some distance could one cut across the <unk> path of the french .
all the <unk> maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a <unk> of its marches , <unk> the only reasonable aim was to <unk> those marches .
to that end kut'uzov 's activity was directed during the whole campaign from moscow to v'ilna - not casually or <unk> but so <unk> that he never once <unk> from it .
this longing to distinguish themselves , to <unk> , to overthrow , and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on the french army .
so it was at <unk> , where they expected to find one of the three french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men .
despite all kut'uzov 's efforts to avoid that <unk> encounter and to preserve his troops , the <unk> of the broken mob of french soldiers by worn - out russians continued at <unk> for three days .
toll wrote a disposition : " the first column will march to so and so , " etc .
and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition .
prince <unk> of w"urttemberg fired from a hill over the french crowds that were running past , and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive .
the french , avoiding the russians , dispersed and hid themselves in the forest by night , making their way round as best they could , and continued their flight .
who was fond of <unk> with the french , sent <unk> demanding their surrender , wasted time , and did not do what he was ordered to do .
* knight without fear and without reproach .
" i give you that column , lads , " he said , riding up to the troops and pointing out the french to the cavalry .
these men , carried away by their passions , were but blind tools of the most melancholy law of necessity , but considered themselves <unk> and imagined that they were <unk> a most noble and honorable deed .
chapter v
in 1812 and <unk> kut'uzov was openly accused of <unk> .
the emperor was dissatisfied with him .
* history of the year 1812 .
the character of kut'uzov and reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at <unk> , by <unk> .
the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for <unk> the higher laws .
still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all kut'uzov 's efforts were directed in 1812 .
when count rostopch'in at the ya'uza bridge galloped up to kut'uzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of moscow , and said : " how was it you promised not to abandon moscow without a battle ? "
kut'uzov replied : " and i shall not abandon moscow without a battle , " though moscow was then already abandoned .
what did it matter to him - who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening
- what did it matter to him whether rostopch'in attributed the <unk> of moscow to him or to himself ?
still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery .
but that man , so <unk> of his words ,
did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word <unk> with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war .
obviously in spite of himself , in very diverse circumstances , he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood .
he alone said that the loss of moscow is not the loss of russia .
in reply to <unk> 's proposal of peace , he said : there can be no peace , for such is the people 's will .
nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events .
this <unk> kut'uzov , whose <unk> was " patience and time , " this enemy of decisive action , gave battle at borodin'o , <unk> the preparations for it with <unk> solemnity .
he alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles , which were useless then , should not be fought , and that a new war should not be begun nor the <unk> of russia crossed .
the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then <unk> lay in the <unk> feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength .
and only that feeling placed him on that highest human <unk> from which he , the commander in chief , devoted all his powers not to <unk> and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them .
that simple , modest , and therefore truly great , figure could not be cast in the false <unk> of a european hero - the supposed ruler of men - that history has invented .
to a <unk> no man can be great , for a <unk> has his own conception of greatness .
chapter vi
the fifth of november was the first day of what is called the battle of <unk> .
his headquarters had that day been transferred .
the day was clear and frosty .
kut'uzov rode to <unk> on his plump little white horse , followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back .
all along the road groups of french prisoners captured that day ( there were seven thousand of them ) were crowding to warm themselves at campfires .
one of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured .
kut'uzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying .
he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners , who presented a specially wretched appearance .
most of them were disfigured by frost - <unk> noses and cheeks , and nearly all had red , swollen and festering eyes .
one group of the french stood close to the road , and two of them , one of whom had his face covered with <unk> , were tearing a piece of <unk> flesh with their hands .
kut'uzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers .
he puckered his face , screwed up his eyes , and pensively swayed his head .
at another spot he noticed a russian soldier <unk> patting a frenchman on the shoulder , saying something to him in a friendly manner , and kut'uzov with the same expression on his face again swayed his head .
" what were you saying ? " he asked the general , who continuing his report directed the commander in chief 's attention to some standards captured from the french and standing in front of the preobrazh'ensk regiment .
" ah , the standards ! " said kut'uzov , evidently <unk> himself with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him .
he looked about him absently .
thousands of eyes were looking at him from all sides awaiting a word from him .
he stopped in front of the preobrazh'ensk regiment , sighed deeply , and closed his eyes .
one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the standards to advance and <unk> the commander in chief with them .
kut'uzov was silent for a few seconds and then , submitting with evident <unk> to the duty <unk> by his position , raised his head and began to speak .
a throng of officers surrounded him .
he looked attentively around at the circle of officers , recognizing several of them .
" i thank you all ! "
he said , addressing the soldiers and then again the officers .
in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly heard .
" i thank you all for your hard and faithful service .
the victory is complete and russia will not forget you !
honor to you forever . "
he paused and looked around .
" lower its head , lower it ! "
he said to a soldier who had accidentally lowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazh'ensk standards . "
lower , lower , that 's it .
hurrah lads ! "
he added , addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin .
" <unk> - r - <unk> ! "
roared thousands of voices .
while the soldiers were shouting kut'uzov leaned forward in his saddle and bowed his head , and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic gleam .
" you see , brothers ... " said he when the shouts had ceased ... and all at once his voice and the expression of his face changed .
it was no longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell his comrades something very important .
there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers , who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say .
" you see , brothers , i know it 's hard for you , but it ca n't be helped !
bear up ; it wo n't be for long now !
we 'll see our visitors off
and then we 'll rest .
the tsar wo n't forget your service .
it is hard for you , but still you are at home while they - you see what they have come to , " said he , pointing to the prisoners . "
worse off than our <unk> <unk> .
while they were strong we did n't spare ourselves , but now we may even pity them .
they are human beings too .
is n't it so , lads ? "
he looked around , and in the direct , respectful , wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said .
his face grew brighter and brighter with an old man 's mild smile , which drew the corners of his lips and eyes into a <unk> of wrinkles .
he ceased speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity .
" but after all who asked them here ?
serves them right , the <unk> <unk> !
" he cried , suddenly lifting his head .
and flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time during the whole campaign , and left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting " hurrah ! "
kut'uzov 's words were hardly understood by the troops .
afterwards when one of the generals addressed kut'uzov asking whether he wished his cal`eche to be sent for , kut'uzov in answering unexpectedly gave a sob , being evidently greatly moved .
chapter vii
when the troops reached their night 's halting place on the eighth of november , the last day of the <unk> battles , it was already growing dusk .
all day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear .
through the falling snow a purple - black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew <unk> .
an infantry regiment which had left <unk> three thousand strong but now <unk> only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting place - a village on the highroad .
the <unk> who met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead frenchmen , <unk> , and members of the staff .
there was only one hut available for the regimental commander .
the commander rode up to his hut .
the regiment passed through the village and <unk> its arms in front of the last huts .
like some huge many - <unk> animal , the regiment began to prepare its <unk> and its food .
another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out <unk> and rye biscuit , and feeding the horses .
some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed , the roof of which had already been removed .
" now then , all together - shove ! "
cried the voices , and the huge surface of the wall , sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost , was seen swaying in the gloom of the night .
the lower <unk> cracked more and more and at last the wall fell , and with it the men who had been pushing it .
loud , coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued .
" now then , catch hold in twos !
hand up the <unk> !
that 's it ....
where are you shoving to ? "
" now , all together !
but wait a moment , boys ...
with a song ! "
all stood silent , and a soft , pleasant velvety voice began to sing .
at the end of the third verse as the last note died away , twenty voices roared out at once : " oo - oo - oo - oo !
that 's it .
all together !
heave away , boys ! ...
" but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved , and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible .
" here , you of the sixth company !
devils that you are !
lend a hand ... will you ?
you may want us one of these days . "
" get along ...
falling ?
what are you stopping for ?
there now .... "
merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely .
" what are you up to ? " suddenly came the <unk> voice of a sergeant major who came upon the men who were <unk> their burden . "
there are gentry here ; the general himself is in that hut , and you foul - <unk> devils , you <unk> , i 'll give it to you ! "
shouted he , hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back .
" ca n't you make less noise ? "
the men became silent .
the soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped his face , which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against the wattle .
" there , how that devil <unk> out !
he 's made my face all <unk> , " said he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on .
" do n't you like it ? "
said a laughing voice , and <unk> their tones the men moved forward .
when they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as before , <unk> their talk with the same <unk> <unk> .
in the hut which the men had passed , the chief officers had gathered and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow .
it was proposed to make a flank march to the left , cut off the vice - king ( murat ) and capture him .
<unk> and <unk> were <unk> all around .
everything was done without any orders being given .
stores of wood were brought for the night , <unk> were <unk> up for the officers , <unk> were being boiled , and muskets and <unk> put in order .
the wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a <unk> by the eighth company as a shelter from the <unk> , <unk> up by musket rests , and a campfire was built before it .
chapter viii
on the contrary , the army had never under the best material conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect .
this was because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were <unk> out of the army day by day .
all the physically or morally weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the army - physically and mentally - remained .
more men collected behind the wattle fence of the eighth company than anywhere else .
two sergeants major were sitting with them and their campfire <unk> brighter than others .
for leave to sit by their wattle they demanded <unk> of <unk> .
" eh , mak'eev !
what has become of you , you son of a bitch ?
are you lost or have the wolves eaten you ?
fetch some more wood ! "
shouted a red - haired and red - faced man , screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire . "
and you , <unk> , go and fetch some wood ! "
said he to another soldier .
this red - haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal , but being <unk> he ordered about those weaker than himself .
" bring it here - that 's fine ! "
they <unk> up the wood , pressed it down on the fire , blew at it with their mouths , and <unk> it with the skirts of their greatcoats , making the flames <unk> and <unk> .
the men drew nearer and lit their pipes .
the handsome young soldier who had brought the wood , setting his arms akimbo , began <unk> his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood .
" mother !
the dew is cold but clear ....
it 's well that i 'm a <unk> ... " he sang , pretending to <unk> after each <unk> .
" look out , your <unk> will fly off ! " shouted the red - haired man , noticing that the sole of the dancer 's boot was hanging loose . "
what a fellow you are for dancing ! "
the dancer stopped , pulled off the loose piece of leather , and threw it on the fire .
" right enough , friend , " said he , and , having sat down , took out of his knapsack a <unk> of blue french cloth , and wrapped it round his foot .
" it 's the <unk> that <unk> them , " he added , stretching out his feet toward the fire .
" they 'll soon be <unk> us new ones .
they say that when we 've finished hammering them , we 're to receive double <unk> ! "
" and that son of a bitch <unk> has <unk> behind after all , it seems , " said one sergeant major .
" i 've had an eye on him this long while , " said the other .
" well , he 's a poor sort of soldier .... "
" but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday . "
" yes , it 's all very well , but when a man 's feet are frozen how can he walk ? "
" eh ? do n't talk nonsense ! " said a sergeant major .
" do you want to be doing the same ? " said an old soldier , turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet .
take me , now !
i 've got no strength left , " he added , with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major . "
tell them to send me to hospital ; i 'm aching all over ; anyway i sha n't be able to keep up . "
" that 'll do , that 'll do ! " replied the sergeant major quietly .
the soldier said no more and the talk went on .
" what a lot of those <unk> were taken today , and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real boots on , " said a soldier , starting a new <unk> .
" they were no more than make - <unk> . "
" the cossacks have taken their boots .
they were clearing the hut for the colonel and carried them out .
it was pitiful to see them , boys , " put in the dancer . "
as they turned them over one seemed still alive and , would you believe it , he <unk> something in their <unk> . "
" well , what do you think ?
they make soldiers of all classes there . "
" but they do n't understand our talk at all , " said the dancer with a puzzled smile .
" i asked him whose subject he was , and he <unk> in his own way .
a queer lot ! "
" was it from the cold ? " asked someone .
" you 're a clever fellow !
from the cold indeed !
why , it was hot .
if it had been from the cold , ours would not have <unk> either . '
but , ' he says , ' go up to ours and they are all <unk> and <unk> .
so , ' he says , ' we tie our faces up with <unk> and turn our heads away as we drag them off : we can hardly do it .
but theirs , ' he says , ' are white as paper and not so much smell as a <unk> of gunpowder . ' "
all were silent .
" it must be from their food , " said the sergeant major .
" they used to <unk> the same food as the gentry . "
no one <unk> him .
" that peasant near mozh'aysk where the battle was said the men were all called up from ten villages around and they <unk> for twenty days and still did n't finish carting the dead away .
and as for the wolves , he says ... "
" that was a real battle , " said an old soldier .
" it 's the only one worth remembering ; but since that ... it 's only been tormenting folk . "
pardon ! '
they say .
that 's only one case .
they say pl'atov took ' <unk> himself twice .
but he did n't know the right charm .
he catches him and catches him - no good !
he turns into a bird in his hands and <unk> away .
and there 's no way of killing him either . "
" you 're a first - class <unk> , <unk> , when i come to look at you ! "
" <unk> , indeed !
it 's the real truth . "
" if he fell into my hands , when i 'd caught him i 'd bury him in the ground with an <unk> stake to fix him down .
what a lot of men he 's ruined ! "
" well , anyhow we 're going to end it .
he wo n't come here again , " remarked the old soldier , <unk> .
the conversation <unk> , and the soldiers began settling down to sleep .
" look at the stars .
it 's wonderful how they <unk> !
you would think the women had spread out their linen , " said one of the men , gazing with admiration at the milky way .
" that 's a sign of a good harvest next year . "
" we shall want some more wood . "
" you warm your back and your belly gets frozen .
that 's queer . "
" o lord ! "
" what are you pushing for ?
is the fire only for you ?
look how he 's <unk> ! "
in the silence that ensued , the <unk> of those who had fallen asleep could be heard .
others turned over and <unk> themselves , now and again exchanging a few words .
from a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound of general , merry laughter .
" <unk> at them <unk> there in the fifth company ! " said one of the soldiers , " and what a lot of them there are ! "
one of the men got up and went over to the fifth company .
" they 're having such fun , " said he , coming back .
" two <unk> have turned up .
one 's quite frozen and the other 's an awful <unk> .
he 's singing songs .... "
" oh , i 'll go across and have a look .... "
and several of the men went over to the fifth company .
chapter ix
the fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest .
a huge campfire was <unk> brightly in the midst of the snow , lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost .
about midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest , and the crackling of dry branches .
" a bear , lads , " said one of the men .
they all raised their heads to listen , and out of the forest into the bright <unk> stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to one another .
these were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest .
they came up to the fire , hoarsely uttering something in a <unk> our soldiers did not understand .
one was <unk> than the other ; he wore an officer 's hat and seemed quite exhausted .
on approaching the fire he had been going to sit down , but fell .
the other , a short <unk> soldier with a shawl tied round his head , was stronger .
he raised his companion and said something , pointing to his mouth .
the soldiers surrounded the frenchmen , spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man , and brought some buckwheat <unk> and vodka for both of them .
the exhausted french officer was ramballe and the man with his head wrapped in the shawl was morel , his orderly .
when morel had drunk some vodka and finished his <unk> of <unk> he suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the soldiers , who could not understand him .
ramballe refused food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire , looking at the russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes .
occasionally he <unk> a long - drawn groan and then again became silent .
morel , pointing to his shoulders , tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that ramballe was an officer and ought to be <unk> .
he rose and tried to walk , but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up .
" you wo n't do it again , eh ? " said one of the soldiers , winking and turning <unk> to ramballe .
" oh , you fool !
why talk rubbish , <unk> that you are - a real peasant ! "
came <unk> from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier .
they surrounded ramballe , lifted him on the crossed arms of two soldiers , and carried him to the hut .
ramballe put his arms around their <unk> while they carried him and began wailing <unk> :
" oh , you fine fellows , my kind , kind friends !
these are men !
oh , my brave , kind friends , " and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one of the men like a child .
meanwhile morel was sitting in the best place by the fire , surrounded by the soldiers .
morel , a short <unk> frenchman with inflamed and <unk> eyes , was wearing a woman 's cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his head over his cap .
he was evidently tipsy , and was singing a french song in a hoarse broken voice , with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier .
the soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him .
" now then , now then , teach us how it goes !
i 'll soon pick it up .
how is it ? " said the man - a <unk> and a wag - whom morel was embracing .
" vive <unk> <unk> !
vive ce roi <unk> ! "
sang morel , winking . "
ce diable ` a <unk> ... " *
* " long live <unk> the fourth , that <unk> king !
that <unk> devil . "
" <unk> !
<unk> - <unk> !
<unk> ! "
repeated the soldier , flourishing his arm and really catching the tune .
" bravo !
ha , ha , ha ! " rose their rough , joyous laughter from all sides .
morel , <unk> up his face , laughed too .
" well , go on , go on ! "
" qui <unk> le <unk> talent , de <unk> , de <unk> , et <unk> un <unk> <unk> . " *
* who had a <unk> talent for drinking , for fighting , and for being a gallant old boy ...
" it goes smoothly , too .
well , now , <unk> ! "
" fine !
just like the <unk> !
oh , ho ho !
do you want some more to eat ? "
" give him some <unk> : it takes a long time to get filled up after starving . "
they gave him some more <unk> and morel with a laugh set to work on his third <unk> .
all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him .
" they are men too , " said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his coat .
" even wormwood <unk> on its own root . "
" o lord , o lord !
how starry it is !
tremendous !
that means a hard frost .... "
they all grew silent .
chapter x
everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plan , and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the <unk> that destroyed the french army .
in reality the results of the crossing were much less <unk> to the french - in guns and men lost - than <unk> had been , as the figures show .
the french crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal .
it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to <unk> its path .
this was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges .
that impulse was reasonable .
the condition of fugitives and of <unk> was equally bad .
as long as they remained with their own people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held among them .
but those who surrendered , while remaining in the same pitiful plight , would be on a lower level to <unk> a share in the <unk> of life .
the most <unk> russian commanders , those favorable to the french - and even the frenchmen in the russian service - could do nothing for the prisoners .
the french perished from the conditions to which the russian army was itself exposed .
it was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and <unk> soldiers to give to the french who , though not harmful , or hated , or guilty , were simply unnecessary .
some russians even did that , but they were <unk> .
certain destruction lay behind the french but in front there was hope .
their <unk> had been burned , there was no salvation save in <unk> flight , and on that the whole strength of the french was concentrated .
anticipation that the <unk> of the petersburg <unk> plan would be attributed to kut'uzov led to dissatisfaction , contempt , and ridicule , more and more strongly expressed .
the ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form , making it impossible for him to ask <unk> he was to blame .
they had heard all that before .
after the <unk> with the army of the brilliant <unk> and petersburg hero <unk> , this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their <unk> .
kut'uzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders .
only once , after the affair of the <unk> , did he get angry and write to bennigsen ( who reported separately to the emperor ) the following letter :
but after bennigsen 's departure , the grand duke tsar'evich <unk> <unk> joined the army .
he had taken part in the beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by kut'uzov .
now having come to the army , he informed kut'uzov of the emperor 's displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the <unk> of their advance .
the emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days ' time .
and he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court .
on the twenty - ninth of november kut'uzov entered v'ilna - his " dear v'ilna " as he called it .
twice during his career kut'uzov had been governor of v'ilna .
in that wealthy town , which had not been injured , he found old friends and associations , besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived .
in undress naval uniform , with a <unk> , and holding his cap under his arm , he handed kut'uzov a <unk> report and the keys of the town .
the contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his <unk> was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of <unk> , who knew of the <unk> that were being directed against kut'uzov .
when speaking to <unk> , kut'uzov <unk> mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at <unk> had been recovered and would be restored to him .
kut'uzov , shrugging his shoulders , replied with his subtle penetrating smile : " i meant merely to say what i said . "
contrary to the emperor 's wish kut'uzov detained the greater part of the army at v'ilna .
those about him said that he became extraordinarily <unk> and physically feeble during his stay in that town .
he attended to army affairs reluctantly , left everything to his generals , and while awaiting the emperor 's arrival led a dissipated life .
in spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle , as well as a guard of honor of the sem"enov regiment .
a minute later the old man 's large stout figure in full - dress uniform , his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach , <unk> out into the porch .
there was running to and fro and whispering ; another troyka flew <unk> up , and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the emperor and volk'onski could already be descried .
from the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect on the old general .
the emperor with a rapid glance scanned kut'uzov from head to foot , frowned for an instant , but immediately mastering himself went up to the old man , extended his arms and embraced him .
and this embrace too , owing to a long - standing impression related to his <unk> feelings , had its usual effect on kut'uzov and he gave a sob .
the emperor greeted the officers and the sem"enov guard , and again pressing the old man 's hand went with him into the castle .
when alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the <unk> of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at <unk> and the <unk> , and informed him of his intentions for a future campaign abroad .
kut'uzov made no rejoinder or remark .
the same submissive , expressionless look with which he had listened to the emperor 's commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now .
when kut'uzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait , he was arrested by someone 's voice saying :
" your serene highness ! "
kut'uzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of count tolst'oy , who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object .
kut'uzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him .
suddenly he seemed to remember ; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face , and bowing low and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver .
it was the order of st. george of the first class .
chapter xi
next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the emperor honored by his presence .
kut'uzov had received the order of st. george of the first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors , but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him .
the <unk> were observed and the emperor was the first to set that example , but everybody understood that the old man was <unk> and good - for - nothing .
the emperor 's displeasure with kut'uzov was specially increased at v'ilna by the fact that kut'uzov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign .
when on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembled about him : " you have not only saved russia , you have saved europe ! "
they all understood that the war was not ended .
he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of <unk> fresh troops , spoke of the <unk> already <unk> by the people , of the possibility of <unk> and so forth .
this being the field marshal 's frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and <unk> to the impending war .
with this object his staff was gradually <unk> and its real strength removed and transferred to the emperor .
toll , konovn'itsyn , and erm'olov received fresh <unk> .
everyone spoke loudly of the field marshal 's great weakness and failing health .
his health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to another .
and in fact his health was poor .
the war of 1812 , besides its <unk> significance dear to every russian heart , was now to assume another , a european , significance .
alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to <unk> and for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> as kut'uzov had been for the salvation and glory of russia .
kut'uzov did not understand what europe , the balance of power , or napoleon meant .
he could not understand it .
for the representative of the russian people , after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had been liberated and raised to the <unk> of her glory , there was nothing left to do as a russian .
nothing remained for the representative of the <unk> war but to die , and kut'uzov died .
chapter xii
as generally happens , pierre did not feel the full effects of the physical <unk> and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after they were over .
after his <unk> he reached <unk> , and on the third day there , when preparing to go to kiev , he fell ill and was laid up for three months .
he had what the doctors termed " <unk> fever . "
but despite the fact that the doctors treated him , bled him , and gave him <unk> to drink , he recovered .
scarcely any impression was left on pierre 's mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness .
he remembered only the dull gray weather now <unk> and now <unk> , internal physical distress , and pains in his feet and side .
on the day of his rescue he had seen the body of p'etya rost'ov .
all this at the time seemed merely strange to pierre : he felt he could not grasp its significance .
but for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of <unk> .
a joyous feeling of freedom - that complete <unk> freedom natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscow - filled pierre 's soul during his convalescence .
he was surprised to find that this inner freedom , which was independent of external conditions , now had as it were an <unk> setting of external liberty .
he was alone in a strange town , without acquaintances .
no one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere .
he had all he wanted : the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there , since she was no more .
" oh , how good !
oh , how good , how splendid ! "
and by old habit he asked himself the question : " well , and what then ?
what am i going to do ? "
and he immediately gave himself the answer : " well , i shall live .
ah , how splendid ! "
the very question that had formerly tormented him , the thing he had continually sought to find - the aim of life - no longer existed for him now .
that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared <unk> - he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again .
and this very absence of an aim gave him the complete , joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this time .
he could not see an aim , for he now had faith - not faith in any kind of rule , or words , or ideas , but faith in an ever - living , ever - manifest god .
formerly he had sought him in aims he set himself .
in his <unk> he had learned that in karat'aev god was greater , more infinite and unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by the freemasons .
he felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet .
all his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him , when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes .
in the past he had never been able to find that great <unk> infinite something .
he had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it .
in everything near and comprehensible he had seen only what was limited , petty , <unk> , and senseless .
he had equipped himself with a mental <unk> and looked into remote space , where petty <unk> hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen .
and such had european life , politics , freemasonry , philosophy , and <unk> seemed to him .
but even then , at moments of weakness as he had <unk> them , his mind had <unk> to those <unk> and he had there seen the same <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
and the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became .
that dreadful question , " what for ? " which had formerly destroyed all his mental <unk> , no longer existed for him .
chapter xiii
in external ways pierre had hardly changed at all .
in appearance he was just what he used to be .
as before he was absent - minded and seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of his own .
formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man , and so people had been inclined to avoid him .
pierre did not in any way seek her approval , he merely studied her with interest .
the most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more successfully , <unk> memories of the best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them .
yet pierre 's cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered , hard , and ( in her own way ) proud princess .
" yes , he is a very , very kind man when he is not under the influence of bad people but of people such as myself , " thought she .
his servants too - <unk> and v'aska - in their own way noticed the change that had taken place in pierre .
they considered that he had become much " simpler . "
<unk> , when he had helped him undress and wished him good night , often lingered with his master 's boots in his hands and clothes over his arm , to see whether he would not start a talk .
and pierre , noticing that <unk> wanted a <unk> , generally kept him there .
" well , tell me ... now , how did you get food ? " he would ask .
" it 's a pleasure to talk to a man like that ; he is not like our <unk> , " he would say .
there were several prisoners from the french army in <unk> , and the doctor brought one of them , a young italian , to see pierre .
this officer began visiting pierre , and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the italian expressed for him .
" if all russians are in the least like you , it is <unk> to fight such a nation , " he said to pierre .
" you , who have suffered so from the french , do not even feel <unk> toward them . "
pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by <unk> the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing .
during the last days of pierre 's stay in <unk> his old masonic acquaintance count willarski , who had introduced him to the lodge in 1807 , came to see him .
willarski was married to a russian heiress who had a large estate in <unk> province , and he occupied a <unk> post in the commissariat department in that town .
hearing that bez'ukhov was in <unk> , willarski , though they had never been intimate , came to him with the <unk> of friendship and intimacy that people who meet in a <unk> generally express for one another .
willarski felt dull in <unk> and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and , as he supposed , of similar interests .
but to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had <unk> much behind the times , and had sunk , as he expressed it to himself , into <unk> and egotism .
" you are letting yourself go , my dear fellow , " he said .
but for all that willarski found it <unk> now than it had been formerly to be with pierre , and came to see him every day .
to pierre as he looked at and listened to willarski , it seemed strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short time before .
willarski was a married man with a family , busy with his family affairs , his wife 's affairs , and his official duties .
he regarded all these occupations as <unk> to life , and considered that they were all <unk> because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family .
military , <unk> , political , and masonic interests continually absorbed his attention .
there was a new <unk> in pierre 's relations with willarski , with the princess , with the doctor , and with all the people he now met , which gained for him the general good will .
this was his <unk> of the impossibility of changing a man 's convictions by words , and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking , feeling , and seeing things each from his own point of view .
this legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to <unk> and irritate pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for , and the interest he took in , other people .
the difference , and sometimes complete contradiction , between men 's opinions and their lives , and between one man and another , pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile .
in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of gravity he had previously lacked .
formerly all <unk> questions , especially <unk> for money to which , as an extremely wealthy man , he was very exposed , produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and perplexity . "
to give or not to give ? " he had asked himself .
" i have it and he needs it .
but someone else needs it still more .
who needs it most ?
and perhaps they are both <unk> ? "
in the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these <unk> and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything to give .
formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his property , when one person advised one thing and another something else .
now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or perplexity about these questions .
there was now within him a judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done .
he was as indifferent as <unk> to money matters , but now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done .
pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort , and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so <unk> difficult .
a further proof to pierre of his own more settled <unk> on practical matters was <unk> by his decision with regard to his wife 's debts and to the <unk> of his houses in and near moscow .
his head steward came to him at <unk> and pierre <unk> up with him his diminished income .
the burning of moscow had cost him , according to the head steward 's <unk> , about two million rubles .
" yes , of course that 's true , " said pierre with a cheerful smile .
" i do n't need all that at all .
by being ruined i have become much <unk> . "
about the same time he received letters from prince vas'ili and other petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife 's debts .
and pierre decided that the steward 's proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to petersburg and settle his wife 's affairs and must <unk> in moscow .
why this was necessary he did not know , but he knew for certain that it was necessary .
his income would be reduced by three <unk> , but he felt it must be done .
willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together .
throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday .
everyone - the <unk> driver , the post - house <unk> , the peasants on the roads and in the villages - had a new significance for him .
the presence and remarks of willarski who continually <unk> the ignorance and <unk> of russia and its <unk> compared with europe only <unk> pierre 's pleasure .
where willarski saw <unk> pierre saw an extraordinary strength and <unk> - the strength which in that vast space amid the <unk> maintained the life of this original , peculiar , and <unk> people .
he did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with him -
an apparent <unk> being the simplest way to avoid <unk> that could lead to nothing - and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him .
chapter xiv
it would be difficult to explain why and <unk> ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurrying :
all was destroyed , except something <unk> yet powerful and <unk> .
the <unk> of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal , and at first for the most part savage and <unk> .
one motive only they all had in common : a desire to get to the place that had been called moscow , to apply their activities there .
within a week moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants , in a fortnight twenty - five thousand , and so on .
by the autumn of <unk> the number , ever increasing and increasing , exceeded what it had been in 1812 .
the first russians to enter moscow were the cossacks of wintzingerode 's detachment , peasants from the <unk> villages , and residents who had fled from moscow and had been hiding in its <unk> .
the russians who entered moscow , finding it plundered , plundered it in their turn .
they continued what the french had begun .
<unk> of peasant carts came to moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets .
the cossacks carried off what they could to their camps , and the <unk> seized all they could find in other houses and moved it to their own , pretending that it was their property .
but the first <unk> were followed by a second and a third <unk> , and with increasing numbers <unk> became more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms .
the french found moscow abandoned but with all the <unk> of regular life , with diverse branches of <unk> and <unk> , with <unk> , and <unk> and religious institutions .
these forms were lifeless but still existed .
the longer the french remained the more these forms of town life perished , until finally all was merged into one confused , lifeless scene of <unk> .
the more the <unk> by the french continued , the more both the wealth of moscow and the strength of its <unk> was destroyed .
within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off <unk> were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out of the town .
other peasants , having heard of their comrades ' <unk> , came to town bringing rye , oats , and hay , and beat down one another 's <unk> to below what they had been in former days .
<unk> of <unk> hoping for high pay arrived in moscow every day , and on all sides logs were being <unk> , new houses built , and old , charred ones <unk> .
tradesmen began <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> and taverns were opened in <unk> burned houses .
the <unk> resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned .
<unk> <unk> church property that had been stolen .
government <unk> set up their <unk> - covered tables and their <unk> of documents in small rooms .
the higher authorities and the police organized the <unk> of goods left behind by the french .
they <unk> the police and <unk> them , made out <unk> at ten times their value for government stores that had perished in the fire , and demanded relief .
and count rostopch'in wrote <unk> .
chapter xv
at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an <unk> of his house which had not been burned .
he called on count rostopch'in and on some acquaintances who were back in moscow , and he intended to leave for petersburg two days later .
everybody was <unk> the victory , everything was <unk> with life in the ruined but <unk> city .
everyone was pleased to see pierre , everyone wished to meet him , and everyone questioned him about what he had seen .
pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all , but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way .
to all questions put to him - whether important or quite trifling - such as : where would he live ?
was he going to <unk> ?
when was he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a <unk> for someone ?-
he replied : " yes , perhaps , " or , " i think so , " and so on .
he had heard that the rost'ovs were at <unk> but the thought of nat'asha seldom occurred to him .
if it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past .
he felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which , it seemed to him , he had aroused in himself .
on the third day after his arrival he heard from the <unk> that princess mary was in moscow .
the death , sufferings , and last days of prince andrew had often occupied pierre 's thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh <unk> .
having heard at dinner that princess mary was in moscow and living in her house - which had not been burned - in vozdv'izhenka street , he drove that same evening to see her .
on his way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew , of their friendship , of his various meetings with him , and especially of the last one at borodin'o .
" is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in ?
is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died ? " thought pierre .
pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood .
the house had escaped the fire ; it showed signs of <unk> but its general aspect was <unk> .
" announce me .
perhaps she will see me , " said pierre .
" yes , sir , " said the man . "
please step into the portrait gallery . "
a few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles , who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment .
in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black .
pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions , but who they were and what they were like he never knew or remembered .
" this must be one of her companions , " he thought , glancing at the lady in the black dress .
the princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand .
" yes , " she said , looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand , " so this is how we meet again .
he spoke of you even at the very last , " she went on , turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant .
" i was so glad to hear of your <unk> .
it was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time . "
again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something , but pierre interrupted her .
" just imagine - i knew nothing about him ! "
said he .
" i thought he had been killed .
all i know i heard at second hand from others .
i only know that he fell in with the rost'ovs ....
what a strange coincidence ! "
pierre spoke rapidly and with animation .
but when he mentioned the rost'ovs , princess mary 's face expressed still greater embarrassment .
she again glanced rapidly from pierre 's face to that of the lady in the black dress and said :
" do you really not recognize her ? "
pierre looked again at the companion 's pale , delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth , and something near to him , long forgotten and more than sweet , looked at him from those attentive eyes .
" but no , it ca n't be ! " he thought .
" this stern , thin , pale face that looks so much older !
it can not be she .
it merely <unk> me of her . "
but at that moment princess mary said , " nat'asha ! "
it <unk> him , seized him , and enveloped him completely .
when she smiled doubt was no longer possible , it was nat'asha and he loved her .
at that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to her , to princess mary , and above all to himself , a secret of which he himself had been unaware .
he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress .
he tried to hide his agitation .
but the more he tried to hide it the more clearly - clearer than any words could have done - did he betray to himself , to her , and to princess mary that he loved her .
" no , it 's only the <unk> of it , " thought pierre .
he became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying .
pierre had failed to notice nat'asha because he did not at all expect to see her there , but he had failed to recognize her because the change in her since he last saw her was immense .
only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly <unk> .
pierre 's confusion was not reflected by any confusion on nat'asha 's part , but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face .
chapter xvi
" she has come to stay with me , " said princess mary .
" the count and countess will be here in a few days .
the countess is in a dreadful state ; but it was necessary for nat'asha herself to see a doctor .
they insisted on her coming with me . "
" yes , is there a family free from sorrow now ? " said pierre , addressing nat'asha . "
you know it happened the very day we were rescued .
i saw him .
what a delightful boy he was ! "
nat'asha looked at him , and by way of answer to his words her eyes <unk> and lit up .
" what can one say or think of as a consolation ? " said pierre .
"
nothing !
why had such a splendid boy , so full of life , to die ? "
" yes , in these days it would be hard to live without faith ... " remarked princess mary .
" yes , yes , that is really true , " pierre hastily interrupted her .
" why is it true ? "
nat'asha asked , looking attentively into pierre 's eyes .
" how can you ask why ? " said princess mary .
"
the thought alone of what awaits ... "
nat'asha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked inquiringly at pierre .
" and because , " pierre continued , " only one who <unk> that there is a god <unk> us can bear a loss such as hers and ... yours . "
nat'asha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped .
pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed princess mary , asking about his friend 's last days .
pierre 's confusion had now almost vanished , but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone .
he felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment <unk> more to him than that of all the rest of the world .
as he spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on nat'asha .
he did not purposely say things to please her , but whatever he was saying he regarded from her <unk> .
princess mary - reluctantly as is usual in such cases - began telling of the condition in which she had found prince andrew .
but pierre 's face quivering with emotion , his questions and his eager restless expression , gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall for her own sake .
" yes , yes , and so ... ? " pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with his whole body and eagerly listened to her story . "
yes , yes ... so he grew tranquil and softened ?
with all his soul he had always sought one thing - to be perfectly good - so he could not be afraid of death .
the <unk> he had - if he had any - were not of his making .
so he did <unk> ? ...
what a happy thing that he saw you again , " he added , suddenly turning to nat'asha and looking at her with eyes full of tears .
nat'asha 's face twitched .
she frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment .
she hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not .
" yes , that was happiness , " she then said in her quiet voice with its deep chest notes .
" for me it certainly was happiness . "
she paused . "
and he ...
he ...
he said he was wishing for it at the very moment
i entered the room .... "
nat'asha 's voice broke .
she blushed , pressed her clasped hands on her knees , and then <unk> herself with an evident effort lifted her head and began to speak rapidly .
" we knew nothing of it when we started from moscow .
i did not dare to ask about him .
then suddenly s'onya told me he was traveling with us .
i had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in
, all i wanted was to see him and be with him , " she said , trembling , and breathing quickly .
and not letting them interrupt her
she went on to tell what she had never yet mentioned to anyone - all she had lived through during those three weeks of their journey and life at yarosl'avl .
pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of tears .
as he listened he did not think of prince andrew , nor of death , nor of what she was telling .
he listened to her and felt only pity for her , for what she was suffering now while she was speaking .
princess mary , frowning in her effort to hold back her tears , sat beside nat'asha , and heard for the first time the story of those last days of her brother 's and nat'asha 's love .
evidently nat'asha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale .
she spoke , mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of her soul , and it seemed as if she could never finish .
several times she repeated the same thing twice .
dessalles ' voice was heard outside the door asking whether little nicholas might come in to say good night .
" well , that 's all - everything , " said nat'asha .
she got up quickly just as nicholas entered , almost ran to the door which was hidden by curtains , struck her head against it , and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow .
pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world .
princess mary roused him from his <unk> by drawing his attention to her nephew who had entered the room .
he wished to take leave of princess mary , but she would not let him go .
"
no , nat'asha
and i sometimes do n't go to sleep till after two , so please do n't go .
i will order supper .
go downstairs , we will come immediately . "
before pierre left the room princess mary told him : " this is the first time she has talked of him like that . "
chapter xvii
pierre was shown into the large , brightly lit dining room ; a few minutes later he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with nat'asha .
nat'asha was calm , though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her face .
they all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and <unk> talk .
it is impossible to go back to the same conversation , to talk of trifles is awkward , and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation .
they went silently to table .
the footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again .
pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and , <unk> to break the silence , looked at nat'asha and at princess mary .
they had evidently both formed the same resolution ; the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy .
" do you take vodka , count ? " asked princess mary , and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past . "
now tell us about yourself , " said she .
" one hears such <unk> <unk> about you . "
" yes , " replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him .
" they even tell me <unk> i myself never dreamed of !
mary <unk> invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened , or ought to have happened , to me .
<unk> <unk> also <unk> me how i ought to tell of my <unk> .
in general i have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man ( i am an interesting man now ) ; people invite me out and tell me all about myself . "
nat'asha smiled and was on the point of speaking .
" we have been told , " princess mary interrupted her , " that you lost two millions in moscow .
is that true ? "
" but i am three times as rich as before , " returned pierre .
though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife 's debts and to <unk> his houses , pierre still maintained that he had become three times as rich as before .
" what i have certainly gained is freedom , " he began seriously , but did not continue , noticing that this <unk> was too <unk> .
" and are you building ? "
" yes . <unk> says i must ! "
" no , " answered pierre , evidently not considering awkward the meaning princess mary had given to his words .
" i heard of it in <unk> and you can not imagine how it <unk> me .
we were not an <unk> couple , " he added quickly , glancing at nat'asha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife , " but her death <unk> me terribly .
when two people quarrel they are always both in fault , and one 's own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive .
and then such a death ... without friends and without consolation !
i am very , very sorry for her , " he concluded , and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on nat'asha 's face .
" yes , and so you are once more an <unk> bachelor , " said princess mary .
pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at nat'asha .
when he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold , stern , and he fancied even contemptuous .
" and did you really see and speak to napoleon , as we have been told ? " said princess mary .
pierre laughed .
" no , not once !
everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being napoleon 's guest .
not only did i never see him but i heard nothing about him - i was in much lower company ! "
supper was over , and pierre who at first declined to speak about his <unk> was gradually led on to do so .
" but it 's true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon ? "
nat'asha asked with a slight smile .
" i guessed it then when we met at the s'ukharev tower , do you remember ? "
pierre admitted that it was true , and from that was gradually led by princess mary 's questions and especially by nat'asha 's into giving a <unk> account of his adventures .
princess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now at nat'asha .
in the whole <unk> she saw only pierre and his goodness .
nat'asha , leaning on her elbow , the expression of her face constantly changing with the <unk> , watched pierre with an attention that never wandered - evidently herself experiencing all that he described .
not only her look , but her <unk> and the brief questions she put , showed pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey .
it was clear that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to , but could not , express in words .
the account pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman for <unk> whom he was arrested was this : " it was an awful sight - children abandoned , some in the flames ...
one was snatched out before my eyes ... and there were women who had their things snatched off and their <unk> torn out ...
" he flushed and grew confused . "
then a patrol arrived and all the men - all those who were not looting , that is - were arrested , and i among them . "
" i am sure you 're not telling us everything ; i am sure you did something ... " said nat'asha and pausing added , " something fine ? "
pierre continued .
when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details , but nat'asha insisted that he should not <unk> anything .
pierre began to tell about karat'aev , but paused .
by this time he had risen from the table and was pacing the room , nat'asha following him with her eyes .
then he added :
" no , you ca n't understand what i learned from that <unk> man - that simple fellow . "
" yes , yes , go on ! " said nat'asha .
" where is he ? "
" they killed him almost before my eyes . "
and pierre , his voice trembling continually , went on to tell of the last days of their retreat , of karat'aev 's illness and his death .
he told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them .
he now , as it were , saw a new meaning in all he had gone through .
now that he was telling it all to nat'asha
nat'asha without knowing it was all attention : she did not lose a word , no single quiver in pierre 's voice , no look , no <unk> of a muscle in his face , nor a single gesture .
she caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open heart , <unk> the secret meaning of all pierre 's mental <unk> .
princess mary understood his story and <unk> with him , but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention .
she saw the possibility of love and happiness between nat'asha and pierre , and the first thought of this filled her heart with <unk> .
it was three o'clock in the morning .
the footmen came in with sad and stern faces to change the candles , but no one noticed them .
pierre finished his story .
nat'asha continued to look at him intently with bright , attentive , and animated eyes , as if trying to understand something more which he had perhaps left <unk> .
pierre in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her , and tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject .
princess mary was silent .
it occurred to none of them that it was three o'clock and time to go to bed .
then for heaven 's sake let me again have <unk> and horseflesh !
we imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual <unk> all is lost , but it is only then that what is new and good begins .
while there is life there is happiness .
there is much , much before us .
i say this to you , " he added , turning to nat'asha .
" yes , yes , " she said , answering something quite different . "
i too should wish nothing but to <unk> it all from the beginning . "
pierre looked intently at her .
" yes , and nothing more , " said nat'asha .
" it 's not true , not true ! " cried pierre .
" i am not to blame for being alive and wishing to live - nor you either . "
suddenly nat'asha bent her head , covered her face with her hands , and began to cry .
" what is it , nat'asha ? " said princess mary .
" nothing , nothing . "
she smiled at pierre through her tears . "
good night !
it is time for bed . "
pierre rose and took his leave .
princess mary and nat'asha met as usual in the bedroom .
they talked of what pierre had told them .
princess mary did not express her opinion of pierre nor did nat'asha speak of him .
" well , good night , mary ! " said nat'asha . "
do you know , i am often afraid that by not speaking of him " ( she meant prince andrew ) " for fear of not doing justice to our feelings , we forget him . "
princess mary sighed deeply and thereby <unk> the justice of nat'asha 's remark , but she did not express <unk> in words .
" is it possible to forget ? " said she .
" it did me so much good to tell all about it today .
it was hard and painful , but good , very good ! "
said nat'asha .
" i am sure he really loved him .
that is why i told him ...
was it all right ? "
she added , suddenly blushing .
" to tell pierre ?
oh , yes .
what a splendid man he is ! " said princess mary .
out of a moral bath .
is n't it true ? "
" yes , " replied princess mary . "
he has greatly improved . "
" with a short coat and his hair <unk> ; just as if , well , just as if he had come straight from the bath ...
papa used to ... "
" i understand why he " ( prince andrew ) " liked no one so much as him , " said princess mary .
" yes , and yet he is quite different .
they say men are friends when they are quite different .
that must be true .
really he is quite unlike him - in everything . "
" yes , but he 's wonderful . "
" well , good night , " said nat'asha .
and the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if it had been forgotten there .
chapter xviii
it was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night .
he paced up and down his room , now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning , now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing , and now smiling happily .
he was thinking of prince andrew , of nat'asha , and of their love , at one moment jealous of her past , then <unk> himself for that feeling .
it was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room .
" well , what 's to be done if it can not be avoided ?
what 's to be done ?
evidently it has to be so , " said he to himself , and hastily undressing he got into bed , happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision .
" strange and impossible as such happiness seems , i must do everything that she and i may be man and wife , " he told himself .
a few days previously pierre had decided to go to petersburg on the friday .
when he awoke on the thursday , <unk> came to ask him about packing for the journey .
" what , to petersburg ?
what is petersburg ?
who is there in petersburg ?
" he asked involuntarily , though only to himself . "
oh , yes , long ago before this happened
i did for some reason mean to go to petersburg , " he reflected .
" why ?
but perhaps i shall go .
what a good fellow he is and how attentive , and how he remembers everything , " he thought , looking at <unk> 's old face , " and what a pleasant smile he has ! "
" well , <unk> , do you still not wish to accept your freedom ? "
pierre asked him .
" what 's the good of freedom to me , your excellency ?
we lived under the late count - the kingdom of heaven be <unk>
we have lived under you too , without ever being wronged . "
" and your children ? "
" the children will live just the same .
with such masters one can live . "
" but what about my heirs ? " said pierre . "
supposing i suddenly marry ...
it might happen , " he added with an involuntary smile .
" if i may take the liberty , your excellency , it would be a good thing . "
" how easy he thinks it , " thought pierre . "
he does n't know how terrible it is and how dangerous .
too soon or too late ... it is terrible ! "
" so what are your orders ?
are you starting tomorrow ?
" asked <unk> .
" no , i 'll put it off for a bit .
i 'll tell you later .
but probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending .
shall i have a talk with him and see what he thinks ? "
pierre reflected . "
no , another time . "
at breakfast pierre told the princess , his cousin , that he had been to see princess mary the day before and had there <unk> do you think ?
nat'asha rost'ova ! "
the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he had seen anna <unk> .
" do you know her ? " asked pierre .
" i have seen the princess , " she replied .
" i heard that they were arranging a match for her with young rost'ov .
it would be a very good thing for the rost'ovs , they are said to be utterly ruined . "
" no ; i mean do you know nat'asha rost'ova ? "
" i heard about that affair of hers at the time .
it was a great pity . "
" no , she either does n't understand or is pretending , " thought pierre .
" better not say anything to her either . "
the princess too had prepared provisions for pierre 's journey .
" how kind they all are , " thought pierre .
" what is surprising is that they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest to them .
and all for me ! "
on the same day the chief of police came to pierre , inviting him to send a representative to the <unk> palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day .
" and this man too , " thought pierre , looking into the face of the chief of police . "
what a fine , good - looking officer and how kind .
fancy <unk> about such trifles now !
and they actually say he is not honest and takes <unk> .
what nonsense !
besides , why should n't he take <unk> ?
that 's the way he was brought up , and everybody does it .
but what a kind , pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me . "
pierre went to princess mary 's to dinner .
as he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down , he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins .
the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> - down walls of the burned - out quarters of the town , stretching out and concealing one another , reminded him of the <unk> and the <unk> .
let 's see what will come of it ! "
at the entrance to princess mary 's house pierre felt <unk> whether he had really been there the night before and really seen nat'asha and talked to her . "
perhaps i imagined it ; perhaps i shall go in and find no one there . "
but he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom .
she was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the day before , yet she was quite different .
had she been like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her .
she was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince andrew 's <unk> .
a bright questioning light shone in her eyes , and on her face was a friendly and strangely <unk> expression .
pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there , but princess mary was going to <unk> and pierre left the house with her .
next day he came early , dined , and stayed the whole evening .
he stayed so long that princess mary and nat'asha exchanged glances , evidently wondering when he would go .
pierre noticed this but could not go .
he felt uneasy and embarrassed , but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his leave .
princess mary , <unk> no end to this , rose first , and <unk> of a headache began to say good night .
" so you are going to petersburg tomorrow ?
" she asked .
" no , i am not going , " pierre replied hastily , in a surprised tone and as though offended .
" yes ... no ... to petersburg ?
tomorrow - but i wo n't say good - by yet .
i will call round in case
you have any commissions for me , " said he , standing before princess mary and turning red , but not taking his departure .
nat'asha gave him her hand and went out .
princess mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into an armchair , and looked sternly and intently at him with her deep , radiant eyes .
the weariness she had plainly shown before had now quite passed off .
with a deep and long - drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a <unk> talk .
when nat'asha left the room pierre 's confusion and awkwardness immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement .
he quickly moved an armchair toward princess mary .
" yes , i wanted to tell you , " said he , answering her look as if she had spoken . "
princess , help me !
what am i to do ?
can i hope ?
princess , my dear friend , listen !
i know it all .
i know i am not worthy of her
, i know it 's impossible to speak of it now .
but i want to be a brother to her .
no , not that , i do n't , i ca n't ... "
he paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands .
" well , " he went on with an evident effort at self - control and <unk> . "
i do n't know when i began to love her , but i have loved her and her alone all my life , and i love her so that i can not imagine life without her .
i can not propose to her at present , but the thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that i may be missing that possibility ... that possibility ... is terrible .
tell me , can i hope ?
tell me what i am to do , dear princess ! "
he added after a pause , and touched her hand as she did not reply .
" i am thinking of what you have told me , " answered princess mary .
" this is what i will say .
you are right that to speak to her of love at present ... "
princess mary stopped .
" to speak to her now would n't do , " said the princess all the same .
" but what am i to do ? "
" leave it to me , " said princess mary .
" i know ... "
pierre was looking into princess mary 's eyes .
" well ? ...
well ? ... " he said .
" i know that she loves ... will love you , " princess mary corrected herself .
before her words were out , pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized princess mary 's hand .
" what makes you think so ?
you think i may hope ?
you think ... ? "
" yes , i think so , " said princess mary with a smile .
" write to her parents , and leave it to me .
i will tell her when i can .
i wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will . "
" no , it can not be !
how happy i am !
but it ca n't be ....
how happy i am !
no , it ca n't be ! "
pierre kept saying as he kissed princess mary 's hands .
" go to petersburg , that will be best .
and i will write to you , " she said .
" to petersburg ?
go there ?
very well , i 'll go .
but i may come again tomorrow ? "
next day pierre came to say good - by .
is it possible ?
no , it ca n't be , " he told himself at every look , gesture , and word that filled his soul with joy .
when on saying good - by he took her thin , slender hand , he could not help holding it a little longer in his own .
no , that 's impossible ! ... "
" good - by , count , " she said aloud .
" i shall look forward very much to your return , " she added in a whisper .
yes , yes , how did she say it ?
yes , ' i shall look forward very much to your return . '
oh , how happy i am !
what is happening to me ?
how happy i am ! " said pierre to himself .
chapter xix
there was nothing in pierre 's soul now at all like what had troubled it during his <unk> of h'el`ene .
there was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had <unk> was right or wrong .
only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind : " was n't it all a dream ?
is n't princess mary mistaken ?
am i not too conceited and self - confident ?
i believe all this - and suddenly princess mary will tell her , and she will be sure to smile and say : ' how strange !
he must be <unk> himself .
does n't he know that he is a man , just a man , while i ... ?
i am something altogether different and higher . ' "
that was the only doubt often troubling pierre .
he did not now make any plans .
the happiness before him appeared so <unk> that if only he could attain it , it would be the end of all things .
everything ended with that .
a joyful , unexpected <unk> , of which he had thought himself incapable , possessed him .
the whole meaning of life - not for him alone but for the whole world - seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her .
at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only - his future happiness .
sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests .
in every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness .
he often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them .
when dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife , her memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he now knew .
prince vas'ili , who having obtained a new post and some fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time , seemed to him a pathetic , kindly old man much to be pitied .
often in <unk> pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity .
all the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true for him always .
he not only did not renounce them subsequently , but when he was in doubt or inwardly at <unk> , he referred to the views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct .
" i may have appeared strange and queer then , " he thought , " but i was not so mad as i seemed .
on the contrary i was then wiser and had more <unk> than at any other time , and understood all that is worth understanding in life , because ... because i was happy . "
chapter xx
everything : her face , walk , look , and voice , was suddenly altered .
to her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction .
from that evening she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened to her .
she no longer complained of her position , did not say a word about the past , and no longer feared to make happy plans for the future .
she spoke little of pierre , but when princess mary mentioned him a long - extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips <unk> with a strange smile .
the change that took place in nat'asha at first surprised princess mary ; but when she understood its meaning it grieved her . "
can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon ?
" she thought when she reflected on the change .
but when she was with nat'asha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach her .
the <unk> power of life that had seized nat'asha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence princess mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart .
nat'asha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad , but bright and cheerful .
when princess mary returned to her room after her <unk> talk with pierre , nat'asha met her on the threshold .
" he has spoken ?
yes ?
he has spoken ?
" she repeated .
and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled on nat'asha 's face .
" i wanted to listen at the door , but i knew you would tell me . "
<unk> and touching as the look with which nat'asha gazed at her seemed to princess mary , and sorry as she was to see her agitation , these words pained her for a moment .
she remembered her brother and his love .
" but what 's to be done ?
she ca n't help it , " thought the princess .
and with a sad and rather stern look she told nat'asha all that pierre had said .
on hearing that he was going to petersburg nat'asha was astounded .
" to petersburg !
" she repeated as if unable to understand .
but noticing the grieved expression on princess mary 's face she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry .
" mary , " said she , " tell me what i should do !
i am afraid of being bad .
whatever you tell me , i will do .
tell me .... "
" you love him ? "
" yes , " whispered nat'asha .
" then why are you crying ?
i am happy for your sake , " said princess mary , who because of those tears quite <unk> nat'asha 's joy .
" it wo n't be just yet - someday .
think what fun it will be when i am his wife and you marry nicholas ! "
" nat'asha , i have asked you not to speak of that .
let us talk about you . "
they were silent awhile .
" but why go to petersburg ? "
nat'asha suddenly asked , and hastily replied to her own question . "
but no , no , he must ...
yes , mary , he must .... "
first <unk> : <unk> - <unk>
chapter i
seven years had passed .
the storm - tossed sea of european history had subsided within its <unk> and seemed to have become calm .
but the mysterious forces that move humanity ( mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us ) continued to <unk> .
though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless , the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time .
various groups of people formed and <unk> , the coming <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of peoples was in course of preparation .
the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from <unk> to <unk> as previously .
it was <unk> in its depths .
historic figures were not borne by the waves from one <unk> to another as before .
they now seemed to <unk> on one spot .
the historians call this activity of the historical figures " the <unk> . "
in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who , in their opinion , caused what they describe as the <unk> .
there is no one in russian <unk> now , from schoolboy <unk> to learned <unk> , who does not throw his little stone at alexander for things he did wrong at this period of his reign .
" he ought to have acted in this way and in that way .
in this case he did well and in that case badly .
he also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and <unk> the sem"enov regiment . "
it would take a dozen pages to <unk> all the reproaches the historians address to him , based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity .
what do these reproaches mean ?
in what does the substance of those reproaches lie ?
the activity of alexander or of napoleon can not be called useful or harmful , for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful .
if that activity <unk> somebody , this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good .
let us assume that this program was possible and had then been <unk> , and that alexander had acted on it .
what would then have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the government - an activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent ?
their activity would not have existed : there would have been no life , there would have been nothing .
if we admit that human life can be <unk> by reason , the possibility of life is destroyed .
chapter ii
if the aim of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been the <unk> of russia , that aim might have been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion .
if the aim was the <unk> of france , that might have been attained without the revolution and without the empire .
if the aim was the <unk> of ideas , the <unk> press could have accomplished that much better than warfare .
if the aim was the progress of <unk> , it is easy to see that there are other ways of <unk> <unk> more <unk> than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives .
why did it happen in this and not in some other way ?
because it happened so ! "
chance created the situation ; genius <unk> it , " says history .
but what is chance ?
what is genius ?
the words chance and genius do not <unk> any really <unk> thing and therefore can not be defined .
those words only <unk> a certain stage of understanding of <unk> .
i do not know why a certain event occurs ; i think that i can not know it ; so i do not try to know it
and i talk about chance .
i see a force <unk> effects beyond the <unk> of ordinary human <unk> ; i do not understand why this occurs
and i talk of genius .
to a <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> the <unk> drives each evening into a special <unk> to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to be a genius .
chapter iii
the <unk> and essential significance of the european events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of the european peoples from <unk> to east and afterwards from east to <unk> .
the commencement of that movement was the movement from <unk> to east .
the ignorance of his <unk> , the weakness and <unk> of his <unk> , the <unk> of his <unk> , and the <unk> and self - confident <unk> of this man raise him to the head of the army .
the brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to <unk> , his <unk> ' <unk> to fight , and his own childish audacity and self - confidence secure him military fame .
innumerable so - called chances accompany him everywhere .
the <unk> into which he falls with the <unk> of france turns to his advantage .
his attempts to avoid his predestined path are <unk> : he is not received into the russian service , and the appointment he seeks in turkey comes to nothing .
during the war in <unk> he is several times on the <unk> of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner .
owing to various diplomatic considerations the russian armies - just those which might have destroyed his <unk> - do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there .
on his return from <unk> he finds the government in paris in a process of <unk> in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out and destroyed .
and by chance an escape from this dangerous position <unk> itself in the form of an <unk> and senseless expedition to africa .
again so - called chance <unk> him .
<unk> <unk> <unk> without a shot ; his most reckless <unk> are crowned with success .
the enemy 's <unk> , which subsequently did not let a single <unk> pass , <unk> his <unk> army to <unk> it .
in africa a whole series of <unk> are committed against the almost <unk> inhabitants .
and the men who commit these <unk> , especially their leader , assure themselves that this is admirable , this is glory - it resembles <unk> and alexander the great and is therefore good .
whatever he does <unk> .
the <unk> does not touch him .
the cruelty of <unk> prisoners is not <unk> to him as a fault .
his <unk> <unk> , uncalled - for , and <unk> departure from africa , leaving his comrades in distress , is set down to his credit , and again the enemy 's <unk> twice lets him slip past .
he had no plan , he was afraid of everything , but the parties snatched at him and demanded his <unk> .
he is pushed into a meeting of the <unk> .
in alarm he wishes to <unk> , considering himself lost .
he <unk> to fall into a <unk> and says senseless things that should have ruined him .
chance , millions of chances , give him power , and all men as if by <unk> co - <unk> to confirm that power .
chance <unk> the duc d'enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him - thereby <unk> the mob more <unk> than in any other way that he had the right , since he had the might .
as if <unk> themselves and preparing for the coming movement , the western forces push toward the east several times in 1805 , 1806 , 1807 , and 1809 , gaining strength and growing .
in 1811 the group of people that had formed in france <unk> into one group with the peoples of <unk> europe .
the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement <unk> with the increased size of the group .
during the ten - year <unk> period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of europe .
the <unk> <unk> of the world can <unk> no reasonable <unk> to the <unk> napoleonic <unk> of glory and grandeur .
one after another they hasten to display their <unk> before him .
it is not napoleon who <unk> himself for the <unk> of his role , so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen .
there is no step , no crime or petty fraud he <unk> , which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed .
the most suitable <unk> the germans can devise for him is a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
not only is he great , but so are his <unk> , his brothers , his <unk> , and his brothers - in - law .
everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part .
and when he is ready so too are the forces .
the invasion <unk> <unk> and <unk> its final goal - moscow .
that city is taken ; the russian army suffers heavier losses than the <unk> armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> , turn back , <unk> again , and all the chances are now not for napoleon but always against him .
a <unk> is then accomplished from east to <unk> with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from <unk> to east .
paris , the <unk> goal , is reached .
the napoleonic government and army are destroyed .
napoleon himself is no longer of any account ; all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean , but again an <unk> chance occurs .
the allies <unk> napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings .
deprived of power and authority , his <unk> and his <unk> exposed , he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later - an <unk> <unk> .
but by some strange chance no one <unk> this .
his part is not yet ended .
chapter iv
the <unk> of nations begins to subside into its normal <unk> .
the waves of the great movement <unk> , and on the calm surface <unk> are formed in which <unk> the <unk> , who imagine that they have caused the <unk> to <unk> .
but the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed .
the <unk> think that their <unk> are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural forces ; they <unk> war between their sovereigns ; the position seems to them insoluble .
but the wave they feel to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect .
it rises again from the same point as before - paris .
the last <unk> of the movement from the <unk> occurs : a <unk> which serves to solve the apparently <unk> diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history .
the man who had <unk> france returns to france alone , without any <unk> and without soldiers .
any guard might arrest him , but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they <unk> the day before and will <unk> again a month later .
this man is still needed to justify the final <unk> act .
that act is performed .
the last <unk> is played .
the <unk> is <unk> to <unk> and wash off his powder and <unk> : he will not be wanted any more .
the <unk> having brought the <unk> to a close and stripped the <unk> shows him to us .
" see what you believed in !
this is he !
do you now see that it was not he
but i who moved you ? "
but <unk> by the force of the movement , it was long before people understood this .
still greater <unk> and inevitability is seen in the life of alexander i , the man who stood at the head of the <unk> from east to <unk> .
what was needed for him who , <unk> others , stood at the head of that movement from east to <unk> ?
during the <unk> war he was inactive because he was not needed .
but as soon as the necessity for a general european war presented itself he appeared in his place at the given moment and , uniting the nations of europe , led them to the goal .
the goal is reached .
after the final war of <unk> alexander possesses all possible power .
how does he use it ?
" not unto us , not unto us , but unto thy name ! ...
i too am a man like the rest of you .
let me live like a man and think of my soul and of god . "
a <unk> settling on a flower has <unk> a child .
and the child is afraid of bees and <unk> that bees exist to <unk> people .
a <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of a flower and says it exists to <unk> the <unk> of flowers .
a beekeeper , seeing the <unk> collect <unk> from flowers and carry it to the hive , says that it exists to <unk> honey .
another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the <unk> <unk> <unk> dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen , and that it exists to <unk> its race .
a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> flying with the <unk> of a male flower to a <unk> <unk> the latter , and sees in this the purpose of the <unk> 's existence .
another , observing the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> <unk> in this work , and may say that in this lies the purpose of the <unk> .
but the <unk> purpose of the <unk> is not exhausted by the first , the second , or any of the <unk> the human mind can <unk> .
the higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these <unk> , the more obvious it becomes , that the <unk> purpose is beyond our <unk> .
all that is <unk> to man is the relation of the life of the <unk> to other <unk> of life .
and so it is with the purpose of historic characters and nations .
chapter v
nat'asha 's wedding to bez'ukhov , which took place in <unk> , was the last happy event in the family of the old rost'ovs .
count ily'a rost'ov died that same year and , as always happens , after the father 's death the family group broke up .
he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events , and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him .
he seemed now frightened and distraught and now unnaturally animated and <unk> .
the arrangements for nat'asha 's marriage occupied him for a while .
he ordered dinners and <unk> and obviously tried to appear cheerful , but his <unk> was not <unk> as it used to be : on the contrary it evoked the <unk> of those who knew and liked him .
when pierre and his wife had left , he grew very quiet and began to complain of depression .
a few days later he fell ill and took to his bed .
he realized from the first that he would not get up again , despite the doctor 's <unk> .
the countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by his pillow without undressing .
every time she gave him his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand .
on his last day , sobbing , he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property - that being the chief fault of which he was conscious .
after receiving communion and unction he quietly died ; and next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects to the deceased filled the house <unk> by the rost'ovs .
you do n't meet such men nowadays ....
and which of us has not weaknesses of his own ? "
it was just when the count 's affairs had become so <unk> that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died .
nicholas was with the russian army in paris when the news of his father 's death reached him .
he at once <unk> his commission , and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to moscow .
the state of the count 's affairs became quite obvious a month after his death , surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected .
the debts amounted to double the value of the property .
friends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance .
but he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father 's memory , which he held sacred , and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance together with the <unk> to pay the debts .
the <unk> who had so long been silent , restrained by a vague but powerful influence <unk> on them while he lived by the count 's careless good nature , all proceeded to <unk> their <unk> at once .
as always happens in such cases <unk> sprang up as to which should get paid first , and those who like m'itenka held <unk> notes given them as <unk> now became the most <unk> of the <unk> .
not one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded ; the estate was sold by <unk> for half its value , and half the debts still remained <unk> .
nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brother - in - law bez'ukhov to pay off debts he regarded as <unk> due for value received .
and to avoid being <unk> for the <unk> , as the <unk> threatened , he re - entered the government service .
nat'asha and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and had no clear idea of nicholas ' circumstances .
having <unk> money from his brother - in - law , nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him .
his position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself , his mother , and s'onya , but had to <unk> his mother from knowledge of their <unk> .
s'onya kept house , attended on her aunt , read to her , put up with her <unk> and secret ill - will , and helped nicholas to conceal their <unk> from the old countess .
nicholas felt himself <unk> <unk> to s'onya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her patience and devotion , but tried to keep aloof from her .
he seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect , and because there was nothing to reproach her with .
she had all that people are valued for , but little that could have made him love her .
he felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her .
he had taken her at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in any case be renewed .
nicholas ' position became worse and worse .
the idea of putting something aside out of his salary proved a dream .
not only did he not save anything , but to comply with his mother 's demands he even <unk> some small debts .
he could see no way out of this situation .
the idea of marrying some rich woman , which was suggested to him by his female relations , was repugnant to him .
the other way out - his mother 's death - never entered his head .
he wished for nothing and hoped for nothing , and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an <unk> endurance of his position .
he seemed carefully to <unk> within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his position .
chapter vi
at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow .
from reports current in town she learned how the rost'ovs were situated , and how " the son has sacrificed himself for his mother , " as people were saying .
" i never expected anything else of him , " said princess mary to herself , feeling a joyous sense of her love for him .
remembering her friendly relations with all the rost'ovs which had made her almost a member of the family , she thought it her duty to go to see them .
but remembering her relations with nicholas in vor'onezh
she was shy about doing so .
making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in moscow .
nicholas was the first to meet her , as the countess ' room could only be reached through his .
but instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had expected , at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold , <unk> , proud expression she had not seen on it before .
he inquired about her health , led the way to his mother , and having sat there for five minutes left the room .
when the princess came out of the countess ' room nicholas met her again , and with <unk> solemnity and <unk> accompanied her to the anteroom .
to her remarks about his mother 's health he made no reply . "
what 's that to you ?
leave me in peace , " his looks seemed to say .
" why does she come <unk> here ?
what does she want ?
i ca n't bear these ladies and all these <unk> ! "
said he aloud in s'onya 's presence , evidently unable to repress his vexation , after the princess ' carriage had disappeared .
" oh , nicholas , how can you talk like that ? " cried s'onya , hardly able to conceal her delight . "
she is so kind and mamma is so fond of her ! "
nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more .
but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a day .
she sang her <unk> , insisted that her son must call on her , expressed a wish to see her often , but yet always became ill - humored when she began to talk about her .
nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess , but his silence irritated her .
" she is a very admirable and excellent young woman , " said she , " and you must go and call on her .
you would at least be seeing somebody , and i think it must be dull for you only seeing us . "
" but i do n't in the least want to , mamma . "
" you used to want to , and now you do n't .
really i do n't understand you , my dear .
one day you are dull , and the next you refuse to see anyone . "
" but i never said i was dull . "
" why , you said yourself you do n't want even to see her .
she is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her , but now suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head .
you hide everything from me . "
" not at all , mamma . "
" if i were asking you to do something disagreeable now - but i only ask you to return a call .
one would think mere politeness required it ....
well , i have asked you , and now i wo n't interfere any more since you have secrets from your mother . "
" well , then , i 'll go if you wish it . "
" it does n't matter to me .
i only wish it for your sake . "
nicholas sighed , bit his mustache , and laid out the cards for a patience , trying to <unk> his mother 's attention to another topic .
the same conversation was repeated next day and the day after , and the day after that .
after her visit to the rost'ovs and her unexpectedly <unk> reception by nicholas , princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right in not wishing to be the first to call .
" i expected nothing else , " she told herself , calling her pride to her aid . "
i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the old lady , who was always kind to me and to whom i am under many obligations . "
but she could not <unk> herself with these reflections ; a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit .
though she had firmly resolved not to call on the rost'ovs again and to forget the whole matter , she felt herself all the time in an awkward position .
and when she asked herself what distressed her , she had to admit that it was her relation to rost'ov .
one day in <unk> when sitting in the <unk> attending to her nephew 's lessons , she was informed that rost'ov had called .
with a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation , she sent for mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing room .
her first glance at nicholas ' face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness , and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in which he addressed her .
nicholas glanced at her and , wishing to appear not to notice her <unk> , made some remark to mademoiselle bourienne and then again looked at the princess .
she still sat motionless with a look of suffering on her gentle face .
he suddenly felt sorry for her and was vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed .
he wished to help her and say something pleasant , but could think of nothing to say .
" good - by , princess ! " said he .
she started , flushed , and sighed deeply .
" oh , i beg your pardon , " she said as if waking up .
" are you going already , count ?
well then , good - by !
oh , but the <unk> for the countess ! "
" wait a moment , i 'll fetch it , " said mademoiselle bourienne , and she left the room .
they both sat silent , with an occasional glance at one another .
" yes , princess , " said nicholas at last with a sad smile , " it does n't seem long ago since we first met at boguch'arovo , but how much water has flowed since then !
in what distress we all seemed to be then , yet i would give much to bring back that time ...
but there 's no bringing it back . "
princess mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as he said this .
she seemed to be trying to <unk> the hidden meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her .
" yes , yes , " said she , " but you have no reason to regret the past , count .
as i understand your present life , i think you will always recall it with satisfaction , because the self - sacrifice that <unk> it now ... "
" i can not accept your praise , " he interrupted her hurriedly .
" on the contrary i continually reproach myself ....
but this is not at all an interesting or cheerful subject . "
his face again resumed its former <unk> and cold expression .
but the princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved , and it was to him that she now spoke .
" i thought you would allow me to tell you this , " she said .
" i had come so near to you ... and to all your family that i thought you would not consider my sympathy <unk> , but i was mistaken , " and suddenly her voice trembled .
" i do n't know why , " she continued , recovering herself , " but you used to be different , and ... "
" there are a thousand reasons why , " laying special emphasis on the why . "
thank you , princess , " he added softly .
" sometimes it is hard . "
" so that 's why !
that 's why ! "
a voice whispered in princess mary 's soul . "
no , it was not only that gay , kind , and frank look , not only that handsome <unk> , that i loved in him .
i <unk> his noble , resolute , self - sacrificing spirit too , " she said to herself . "
yes , he is poor now
and i am rich ....
yes , that 's the only reason ....
yes , were it not for that ... "
and remembering his former tenderness , and looking now at his kind , sorrowful face , she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness .
" but why , count , why ?
" she almost cried , unconsciously moving closer to him . "
why ?
tell me .
you must tell me ! "
he was silent .
" i do n't understand your why , count , " she continued , " but it 's hard for me ...
i confess it .
for some reason you wish to deprive me of our former friendship .
and that hurts me .
" there were tears in her eyes and in her voice .
" i have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard for me to bear ....
excuse me , good - by ! "
and suddenly she began to cry and was hurrying from the room .
" princess , for god 's sake ! " he exclaimed , trying to stop her . "
princess ! "
she turned round .
for a few seconds they gazed silently into one another 's eyes - and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became possible , inevitable , and very near .
chapter vii
in the winter of <unk> nicholas married princess mary and moved to bald hills with his wife , his mother , and s'onya .
in another three years , by <unk> , he had so managed his affairs that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was <unk> to buy back otr'adnoe - that being his pet dream .
having started <unk> from necessity , he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation .
nicholas was a plain <unk> : he did not like <unk> , especially the english ones then coming into vogue .
he always had before his mind 's eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it .
when nicholas first began <unk> and began to understand its different branches , it was the serf who especially attracted his attention .
the peasant seemed to him not merely a <unk> , but also a judge of <unk> and an end in himself .
and nicholas ' management produced very brilliant results .
before <unk> the <unk> of manure , before entering into the <unk> and credit ( as he ironically called it ) , he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means .
he kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible , not <unk> the family groups to <unk> into separate households .
he was hard alike on the <unk> , the depraved , and the weak , and tried to get them <unk> from the commune .
he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs - the " <unk> " as he called them - and everyone said he spoiled them by his <unk> .
he never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants .
he knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few <unk> .
he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man , or to make things easy for or reward anyone , merely because he felt inclined to do so .
he could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do , but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind .
often , speaking with vexation of some <unk> or <unk> , he would say : " what can one do with our russian peasants ? " and imagined that he could not bear them .
yet he loved " our russian peasants " and their way of life with his whole soul , and for that very reason had understood and <unk> the one way and manner of <unk> which produced good results .
she felt he had a world apart , which he loved passionately and which had laws she had not <unk> .
that 's all poetry and old wives ' talk - all that doing good to one 's neighbor !
what i want is that our children should not have to go begging .
i must put our affairs in order while i am alive , that 's all .
and to do that , order and <unk> are essential ....
that 's all about it ! "
said he , clenching his vigorous fist . "
and <unk> , of course , " he added , " for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse , he can do no good either for himself or for me . "
and all nicholas did was <unk> - probably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue 's sake .
his means increased rapidly ; serfs from neighboring estates came to beg him to buy them , and long after his death the memory of his <unk> was <unk> preserved among the serfs . "
he was a master ... the peasants ' affairs first and then his own .
of course he was not to be <unk> with either - in a word , he was a real master ! "
chapter viii
one matter connected with his management sometimes worried nicholas , and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making free use of his fists .
at first he saw nothing <unk> in this , but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of <unk> suddenly changed .
once in summer he had sent for the village elder from boguch'arovo , a man who had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused of <unk> and various <unk> .
nicholas went out into the porch to question him , and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the sound of cries and blows were heard .
on returning to lunch nicholas went up to his wife , who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame , and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning .
among other things he spoke of the boguch'arovo elder .
countess mary turned red and then pale , but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her husband no reply .
" such an insolent scoundrel ! "
he cried , growing hot again at the mere recollection of him . "
if he had told me he was drunk and did not see ...
but what is the matter with you , mary ?
" he suddenly asked .
countess mary raised her head and tried to speak , but hastily looked down again and her lips puckered .
" why , whatever is the matter , my dearest ? "
the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in tears .
she never cried from pain or vexation , but always from sorrow or pity , and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm .
the moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself and began to cry .
" nicholas , i saw it ... he was to blame , but why do you ...
nicholas ! "
and she covered her face with her hands .
nicholas said nothing .
he flushed crimson , left her side , and paced up and down the room .
he understood what she was weeping about , but could not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong .
" is it just <unk> , old wives ' tales , or is she right ? " he asked himself .
before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain , and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been <unk> against himself .
" mary , " he said softly , going up to her , " it will never happen again ; i give you my word .
never , " he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy asking for forgiveness .
the tears flowed faster still from the countess ' eyes .
she took his hand and kissed it .
" nicholas , when did you break your <unk> ? " she asked to change the subject , looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a <unk> of <unk> 's head .
" today - it was the same affair .
oh , mary , do n't remind me of it ! "
and again he flushed .
" i give you my word of honor it sha n't occur again , and let this always be a <unk> to me , " and he pointed to the broken ring .
but he did forget himself once or twice within a <unk> , and then he would go and confess to his wife , and would again promise that this should really be the very last time .
" mary , you must despise me ! " he would say .
" i deserve it . "
" you should go , go away at once , if you do n't feel strong enough to control yourself , " she would reply sadly , trying to comfort her husband .
among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not liked .
he did not <unk> himself with the interests of his own class , and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid .
the whole summer , from spring <unk> to harvest , he was busy with the work on his <unk> .
in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same business - like <unk> - leaving home for a month , or even two , with his hunt .
in winter he visited his other villages or spent his time reading .
the books he read were chiefly historical , and on these he spent a certain sum every year .
he was collecting , as he said , a serious library , and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought .
in winter , except for business <unk> , he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his children 's relations with their mother .
the harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual <unk> in her .
from the time of his marriage s'onya had lived in his house .
before that , nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and s'onya , <unk> himself and <unk> her .
he had asked princess mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin .
she thoroughly realized the wrong he had done s'onya , felt herself to blame toward her , and imagined that her wealth had <unk> nicholas ' choice .
she could not find fault with s'onya in any way and tried to be fond of her , but often felt ill - will toward her which she could not overcome .
once she had a talk with her friend nat'asha about s'onya and about her own injustice toward her .
" you know , " said nat'asha , " you have read the gospels a great deal - there is a passage in them that just fits s'onya . "
" what ? " asked countess mary , surprised .
" ' to him that <unk> shall be given , and from him that <unk> not shall be taken away . '
you remember ?
she is one that <unk> not ; why , i do n't know .
perhaps she <unk> egotism , i do n't know , but from her is taken away , and everything has been taken away .
sometimes i am dreadfully sorry for her .
formerly i very much wanted nicholas to marry her , but i always had a sort of presentiment that it would not come off .
she is a <unk> flower , you know - like some <unk> <unk> .
sometimes i am sorry for her , and sometimes i think she does n't feel it as you or i would . "
though countess mary told nat'asha that those words in the gospel must be understood differently , yet looking at s'onya she agreed with nat'asha 's explanation .
it really seemed that s'onya did not feel her position trying , and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a <unk> flower .
she seemed to be fond not so much of <unk> as of the family as a whole .
like a <unk> , she had attached herself not to the people but to the home .
she waited on the old countess , <unk> and spoiled the children , was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift , and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient gratitude .
the country seat at bald hills had been <unk> , though not on the same <unk> as under the old prince .
the buildings , begun under <unk> circumstances , were more than simple .
the immense house on the old stone <unk> was of wood , <unk> only inside .
it had bare deal <unk> and was <unk> with very simple hard <unk> , <unk> , tables , and chairs made by their own serf <unk> out of their own <unk> .
the house was <unk> and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors .
whole families of the rost'ovs ' and <unk> ' relations sometimes came to bald hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months .
besides that , four times a year , on the name days and <unk> of the <unk> , as many as a hundred visitors would <unk> there for a day or two .
the rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations , and its <unk> , <unk> , dinners , and <unk> , provided out of the produce of the estate .
chapter ix
it was the eve of st. nicholas , the fifth of december , <unk> .
nat'asha had been staying at her brother 's with her husband and children since early autumn .
pierre had gone to petersburg on business of his own for three weeks as he said , but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was expected back every minute .
besides the bez'ukhov family , nicholas ' old friend the retired general vas'ili dm'itrich den'isov was staying with the rost'ovs this fifth of december .
he examined the <unk> 's accounts of the village in ryaz'an which belonged to his wife 's nephew , wrote two business letters , and walked over to the <unk> , cattle yards and <unk> before dinner .
countess mary sat at the other end of the table .
but today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should be angry with her without any reason , and she felt unhappy .
she asked him where he had been .
he replied .
she again inquired whether everything was going well on the <unk> .
her unnatural tone made him <unk> unpleasantly and he replied hastily .
" then i 'm not mistaken , " thought countess mary .
" why is he cross with me ? "
she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished to end the conversation .
she knew her remarks sounded unnatural , but could not refrain from asking some more questions .
thanks to den'isov the conversation at table soon became general and lively , and she did not talk to her husband .
when they left the table and went as usual to thank the old countess , countess mary held out her hand and kissed her husband , and asked him why he was angry with her .
" you always have such strange fancies !
i did n't even think of being angry , " he replied .
but the word always seemed to her to <unk> : " yes , i am angry but i wo n't tell you why . "
" well , <unk> et <unk> , " said nicholas loudly and with apparent <unk>
( it seemed to countess mary that he did it on purpose to <unk> her ) , " i have been on my feet since six this morning .
tomorrow i shall have to suffer , so today i 'll go and rest . "
and without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa .
" that 's always the way , " thought countess mary . "
he talks to everyone except me .
i see ...
i see that i am <unk> to him , especially when i am in this condition .
" she looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at her pale , sallow , emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than ever .
and everything annoyed her - den'isov 's shouting and laughter , nat'asha 's talk , and especially a quick glance s'onya gave her .
s'onya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling irritated .
having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of what they were saying , she softly left the room and went to the nursery .
the children were playing at " going to moscow " in a carriage made of chairs and invited her to go with them .
she sat down and played with them a little , but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable <unk> worried her .
she got up and , walking on tiptoe with difficulty , went to the small sitting room .
" perhaps he is not asleep ; i 'll have an explanation with him , " she said to herself .
little andrew , her eldest boy , imitating his mother , followed her on tiptoe .
she did not notice him .
" mary , dear , i think he is asleep - he was so tired , " said s'onya , meeting her in the large sitting room
( it seemed to countess mary that she crossed her path everywhere ) . "
andrew may wake him . "
countess mary looked round , saw little andrew following her , felt that s'onya was right , and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh .
she made no reply , but to avoid obeying s'onya beckoned to andrew to follow her quietly and went to the door .
s'onya went away by another door .
from the room in which nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing , every slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife .
as she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead , his mustache , and his whole face , as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept .
nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat .
and at that moment little andrew shouted from outside the door : "
papa !
mamma 's standing here ! "
countess mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy .
he grew silent , and quiet ensued for a moment , terrible to countess mary .
she knew how nicholas disliked being <unk> .
then through the door she heard nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring , and his voice said crossly :
" i ca n't get a moment 's peace ....
mary , is that you ?
why did you bring him here ? "
" i only came in to look and did not notice ... forgive me .... "
nicholas coughed and said no more .
countess mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery .
nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face .
" nat'asha , nat'asha ! " came countess mary 's frightened whisper from the door .
" papa wants to sleep . "
" no , mamma , he does n't want to sleep , " said little nat'asha with conviction .
" he 's laughing . "
nicholas lowered his legs , rose , and took his daughter in his arms .
" come in , mary , " he said to his wife .
she went in and sat down by her husband .
" i did not notice him following me , " she said timidly .
" i just looked in . "
holding his little girl with one arm , nicholas glanced at his wife and , seeing her guilty expression , put his other arm around her and kissed her hair .
" may i kiss mamma ?
" he asked nat'asha .
nat'asha smiled <unk> .
" again ! " she commanded , pointing with a <unk> gesture to the spot where nicholas had placed the kiss .
" i do n't know why you think i am cross , " said nicholas , replying to the question he knew was in his wife 's mind .
" you have no idea how unhappy , how <unk> , i feel when you are like that .
it always seems to me ... "
" mary , do n't talk nonsense .
you ought to be ashamed of yourself ! "
he said gaily .
" it seems to be that you ca n't love me , that i am so plain ... always ... and now ... in this <unk> ... "
" oh , how absurd you are !
it is not beauty that <unk> , it 's love that makes us see beauty .
it is only <unk> and women of that kind who are loved for their beauty .
but do i love my wife ?
i do n't love her , but ...
i do n't know how to put it .
without you , or when something comes between us like this , i seem lost and ca n't do anything .
now do i love my finger ?
i do n't love it , but just try to cut it off ! "
" i 'm not like that myself , but i understand .
so you 're not angry with me ? "
" awfully angry ! " he said , smiling and getting up .
and smoothing his hair he began to pace the room .
" do you know , mary , what i 've been thinking ?
" he began , immediately thinking aloud in his wife 's presence now that they had made it up .
he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him .
he did not care .
a thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also .
and he told her of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till spring .
countess mary listened till he had finished , made some remark , and in her turn began thinking aloud .
her thoughts were about the children .
" you can see the woman in her already , " she said in french , pointing to little nat'asha .
" you reproach us women with being <unk> .
here is our <unk> .
i say : ' papa wants to sleep ! '
but she says , ' no , he 's laughing . '
and she was right , " said countess mary with a happy smile .
" yes , yes . "
and nicholas , taking his little daughter in his strong hand , lifted her high , placed her on his shoulder , held her by the legs , and paced the room with her .
there was an expression of <unk> happiness on the faces of both father and daughter .
" but you know you may be <unk> .
you are too fond of this one , " his wife whispered in french .
" yes , but what am i to do ? ...
i try not to show ... "
at that moment they heard the sound of the door <unk> and footsteps in the hall and anteroom , as if someone had arrived .
" somebody has come . "
" i am sure it is pierre .
i will go and see , " said countess mary and left the room .
in her absence nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a gallop round the room .
out of breath , he took the laughing child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart .
" it is he , it is he , nicholas ! " said countess mary , re - entering the room a few minutes later .
" now our nat'asha has come to life .
you should have seen her ecstasy , and how he caught it for having stayed away so long .
well , come along now , quick , quick !
it 's time you two were parted , " she added , looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father .
nicholas went out holding the child by the hand .
countess mary remained in the sitting room .
" i should never , never have believed that one could be so happy , " she whispered to herself .
chapter x
nat'asha had married in the early spring of <unk> , and in <unk> already had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was now nursing .
she had grown stouter and <unk> , so that it was difficult to recognize in this <unk> , <unk> woman the slim , lively nat'asha of former days .
her features were more defined and had a calm , soft , and serene expression .
in her face there was none of the ever - glowing animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm .
now her face and body were often all that one saw , and her soul was not visible at all .
all that struck the eye was a strong , handsome , and <unk> woman .
the old fire very rarely kindled in her face now .
at the rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome , fully <unk> body she was even more attractive than in former days .
since their marriage nat'asha and her husband had lived in moscow , in petersburg , on their estate near moscow , or with her mother , that is to say , in nicholas ' house .
the young countess bez'ukhova was not often seen in society , and those who met her there were not pleased with her and found her neither attractive nor amiable .
not that nat'asha liked solitude - she did not know whether she liked it or not , she even thought that she did not -
but with her <unk> , her <unk> , the nursing of her children , and <unk> every moment of her husband 's life , she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by <unk> society .
all who had known nat'asha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something extraordinary .
" only she lets her love of her husband and children <unk> all <unk> , " said the countess , " so that it even becomes absurd . "
nat'asha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her <unk> , of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part .
she gave it up just because it was so <unk> <unk> .
she acted in contradiction to all those rules .
she felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her , but by something else - indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul .
to <unk> out her curls , put on fashionable dresses , and sing romantic songs to <unk> her husband would have seemed as strange as to <unk> herself to attract herself .
to <unk> herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable -
she did not know -
but she had no time at all for it .
the chief reason for <unk> no time either to singing , to dress , or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things .
and the deeper she <unk> , not with her mind only but with her whole soul , her whole being , into the subject that absorbed her , the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more <unk>
did her powers appear , so that she concentrated them <unk> on that one thing and yet was unable to <unk> all that she considered necessary .
if the purpose of marriage is the family , the person who wishes to have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure , but in that case will not have a family .
nat'asha needed a husband .
a husband was given her and he gave her a family .
nat'asha did not care for society in general , but <unk> the more the society of her relatives - countess mary , and her brother , her mother , and s'onya .
the general opinion was that pierre was under his wife 's thumb , which was really true .
from the very first days of their married life nat'asha had announced her demands .
pierre was greatly surprised by his wife 's view , to him a perfectly novel one , that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family .
his wife 's demands astonished him , but they also flattered him , and he submitted to them .
to make up for this , at home pierre had the right to <unk> his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose .
at home nat'asha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband , and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied - that is , was reading or writing in his study .
pierre had but to show a <unk> for anything to get just what he liked done always .
he had only to express a wish and nat'asha would <unk> up and run to fulfill it .
the <unk> household was governed according to pierre 's supposed orders , that is , by his wishes which nat'asha tried to guess .
and she <unk> the <unk> of his wishes quite correctly , and having once arrived at them clung to them <unk> .
when pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons .
after seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness that he was not a bad man , and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife .
he felt the good and bad within himself <unk> mingled and <unk> .
but only what was really good in him was reflected in his wife , all that was not quite good was <unk> .
and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection .
chapter xi
on reading that letter ( she always read her husband 's letters )
nat'asha herself suggested that he should go to petersburg , though she would feel his absence very <unk> .
she attributed immense importance to all her husband 's intellectual and <unk> interests though she did not understand them , and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters .
to pierre 's timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go , but to fix a definite <unk> for his return .
he was given four weeks ' leave of absence .
ever since that leave of absence had <unk> , more than a fortnight before , nat'asha had been in a constant state of alarm , depression , and irritability .
den'isov , now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with the present state of affairs , had arrived during that fortnight .
he looked at nat'asha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad <unk> of a person once dear .
a dull , dejected look , random replies , and talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress .
" it 's all nonsense , all rubbish - those <unk> which lead to nothing and all those idiotic <unk> ! "
nat'asha declared of the very affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed .
and she would go to the nursery to nurse p'etya , her only boy .
no one else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this little three - month - old creature when he lay at her breast
and she was conscious of the movement of his lips and the <unk> of his little nose .
that creature said : " you are angry , you are jealous , you would like to pay him out , you are afraid - but here am i !
and i am he ... " and that was <unk> .
it was more than true .
during that fortnight of anxiety nat'asha <unk> to the baby for comfort so often , and <unk> over him so much , that she <unk> him and he fell ill .
she was terrified by his illness , and yet that was just what she needed .
while attending to him she bore the anxiety about her husband more easily .
" has he come ? "
nat'asha asked quickly in a whisper , afraid to move lest she should <unk> the dozing baby .
" he 's come , ma'am , " whispered the nurse .
the blood rushed to nat'asha 's face and her feet involuntarily moved , but she could not <unk> up and run out .
the baby again opened his eyes and looked at her .
" you 're here ? "
he seemed to be saying , and again <unk> <unk> his lips .
cautiously <unk> her breast , nat'asha <unk> him a little , handed him to the nurse , and went with rapid steps toward the door .
but at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her joy left the child too soon , and she glanced round .
the nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the <unk> of his cot .
" go , ma'am !
do n't worry , go ! "
she whispered , smiling , with the kind of familiarity that <unk> up between a nurse and her mistress .
nat'asha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom .
den'isov , who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his pipe , now for the first time recognized the old nat'asha .
a <unk> of brilliant , joyful light poured from her <unk> face .
" he 's come ! " she exclaimed as she ran past , and den'isov felt that he too was delighted that pierre , whom he did not much care for , had returned .
on reaching the vestibule nat'asha saw a tall figure in a fur coat <unk> his scarf .
" it 's he !
it 's really he !
he has come ! "
she said to herself , and rushing at him embraced him , pressed his head to her breast , and then pushed him back and gazed at his <unk> , happy face , covered with hoarfrost . "
yes , it is he , happy and contented .... "
" yes , it 's all very well for you .
you are pleased , you 've had a good time ....
but what about me ?
you might at least have shown consideration for the children .
i am nursing and my milk was spoiled ....
p'etya was at death 's door .
but you were enjoying yourself .
yes , enjoying ... "
he wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so .
he made a piteous , frightened face and bent down .
" i could not , on my honor .
but how is p'etya ? "
" all right now .
come along !
i wonder you 're not ashamed !
if only you could see what i was like without you , how i suffered ! "
" you are well ? "
" come , come ! "
she said , not letting go of his arm .
and they went to their rooms .
when nicholas and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the nursery holding his baby son , who was again awake , on his huge right palm and <unk> him .
a blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby 's broad face with its <unk> open mouth .
the storm was long since over and there was bright , joyous sunshine on nat'asha 's face as she gazed tenderly at her husband and child .
" and have you talked everything well over with prince theodore ? "
she asked .
" yes , <unk> . "
" you see , he <unk> it up . "
( she meant the baby 's head . ) "
but how he did frighten me ...
you 've seen the princess ?
is it true
she 's in love with that ... "
" yes , just fancy ... "
at that moment nicholas and countess mary came in .
pierre with the baby on his hand stooped , kissed them , and replied to their inquiries .
but in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed , the baby with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his attention .
" how sweet ! " said countess mary , looking at and playing with the baby . "
now , nicholas , " she added , turning to her husband , " i ca n't understand how it is you do n't see the charm of these delicious <unk> . "
" i do n't and ca n't , " replied nicholas , looking coldly at the baby . "
a <unk> of flesh .
come along , pierre ! "
" and yet he 's such an affectionate father , " said countess mary , <unk> her husband , " but only after they are a year old or so ... "
" now , pierre nurses them splendidly , " said nat'asha . "
he says his hand is just made for a baby 's seat .
just look ! "
" only not for this ... " pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh , and shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse .
chapter xii
as in every large household , there were at bald hills several perfectly distinct <unk> which merged into one <unk> whole , though each retained its own <unk> and made <unk> to the others .
every event , joyful or sad , that took place in that house was important to all these <unk> , but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the others .
for instance , pierre 's return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so .
the children and their governesses were glad of pierre 's return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did .
no one had <unk> into him this love for pierre whom he saw only occasionally .
countess mary who had brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him , and little nicholas did love his uncle , but loved him with just a shade of contempt .
pierre , however , he adored .
he did not want to be an hussar or a knight of st. george like his uncle nicholas ; he wanted to be learned , wise , and kind like pierre .
in pierre 's presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when pierre spoke to him .
he did not miss a single word he uttered , and would afterwards , with dessalles or by himself , recall and <unk> the meaning of everything pierre had said .
but the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a <unk> who could not be pictured , and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture .
so the boy also was happy that pierre had arrived .
the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in .
the grown - up members of the family , not to mention his wife , were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully .
the old ladies were pleased with the <unk> he brought them , and especially that nat'asha would now be herself again .
pierre felt the different <unk> of these various <unk> and made haste to satisfy all their expectations .
but in time he grew used to this demand .
if he now <unk> nat'asha 's censure it was only for <unk> too many and too <unk> things .
to her other <unk> ( as most people thought them , but which to pierre were qualities ) of <unk> and neglect of herself , she now added <unk> .
life was <unk> because it was <unk> : that most <unk> <unk> , the kind of life that can be changed at any moment , was no longer his nor did he wish for it .
he felt that his way of life had now been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in his power , and so that way of life proved <unk> .
with a merry , smiling face pierre was sorting his <unk> .
" what do you think of this ? " said he , <unk> a piece of stuff like a <unk> .
nat'asha , who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her <unk> , turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he showed her .
" that 's for <unk> ?
excellent ! "
she felt the quality of the material .
" it was a ruble an <unk> , i suppose ? "
pierre told her the price .
" too dear ! "
nat'asha remarked . "
how pleased the children will be and mamma too !
only you need not have bought me this , " she added , unable to suppress a smile as she gazed <unk> at a gold <unk> set with pearls , of a kind then just coming into fashion .
" <unk> <unk> me : she kept on telling me to buy it , " returned pierre .
" when am i to wear it ? " and nat'asha stuck it in her <unk> of hair . "
when i take little m'asha into society ?
perhaps they will be fashionable again by then .
well , let 's go now . "
and collecting the <unk> they went first to the nursery and then to the old countess ' rooms .
the countess was sitting with her companion <unk> , playing grand - patience as usual , when pierre and nat'asha came into the drawing room with <unk> under their arms .
the countess was now over sixty , was quite gray , and wore a cap with a <unk> that surrounded her face .
her face had shriveled , her upper lip had sunk in , and her eyes were dim .
after the <unk> of her son and husband in such rapid <unk> , she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left without aim or object for her existence .
she ate , drank , slept , or kept awake , but did not live .
life gave her no new impressions .
she wanted nothing from life but tranquillity , and that tranquillity only death could give her .
but until death came she had to go on living , that is , to use her vital forces .
a peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in her .
her life had no external aims - only a need to exercise her various <unk> and <unk> was apparent .
she did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full <unk> of life do , when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their <unk> remains unnoticed .
she talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and lungs .
she cried as a child does , because her nose had to be cleared , and so on .
what for people in their full <unk> is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext .
thus in the morning - especially if she had eaten anything rich the day before - she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the <unk> pretext <unk> 's <unk> .
she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end of the room .
" it seems a little warmer today , my dear , " she would murmur .
and when <unk> replied : " oh yes , they 've come , " she would <unk> angrily : " o lord !
how stupid and deaf she is ! "
another pretext would be her snuff , which would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough .
after these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow , and her maids knew by <unk> symptoms when <unk> would again be deaf , the snuff damp , and the countess ' face yellow .
just as she needed to work off her <unk>
so she had sometimes to exercise her still - <unk> faculty of thinking - and the pretext for that was a game of patience .
when she needed to cry , the deceased count would be the pretext .
when she wanted to be agitated , nicholas and his health would be the pretext , and when she felt a need to speak <unk> , the pretext would be countess mary .
the old lady 's condition was understood by the whole household though no one ever spoke of it , and they all made every possible effort to satisfy her needs .
only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between nicholas , pierre , nat'asha , and countess mary was the common understanding of her condition expressed .
<unk> <unk> , " said these glances .
only the really heartless , the stupid ones of that household , and the little children failed to understand this and avoided her .
chapter xiii
when pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of her customary <unk> in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience , and so - though by force of habit
she greeted him with the words she always used when pierre or her son returned after an absence : " high time , my dear , high time !
we were all weary of waiting for you .
well , thank god ! " and received her <unk> with another customary remark : " it 's not the gift that 's precious , my dear , but that you give it to me , an old woman ...
<unk>
it was evident that she was not pleased by pierre 's arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished game .
she finished her game of patience and only then examined the <unk> .
the countess had long wished for such a box , but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced <unk> at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards .
" thank you , my dear , you have cheered me up , " said she as she always did . "
but best of all you have brought yourself back - for i never saw anything like it , you ought to give your wife a scolding !
what are we to do with her ?
she is like a mad woman when you are away .
does n't see anything , does n't remember anything , " she went on , repeating her usual phrases . "
look , anna <unk> , " she added to her companion , " see what a box for cards my son has brought us ! "
<unk> admired the <unk> and was delighted with her dress material .
conversation of this kind , interesting to no one yet <unk> , continued all through <unk> .
all the grown - up members of the family were assembled near the round tea table at which s'onya <unk> beside the samovar .
the children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and their voices were audible from the next room .
he spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand .
but to the old countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society .
nat'asha saw by pierre 's animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess .
once or twice pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things , but nicholas and nat'asha always brought him back to the health of prince iv'an and countess mary <unk> .
" well , and all this <unk> - <unk> and <unk> ? "
den'isov asked . "
is that <unk> still going on ? "
" going on ? "
pierre exclaimed .
" why more than ever !
the <unk> society is the whole government now ! "
" what is that , mon cher ami ? " asked the countess , who had finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her <unk> .
" what are you saying about the government ?
i do n't understand . "
" arakch'eev and gol'itsyn , " <unk> remarked pierre , " are now the whole government !
and what a government !
they see <unk> everywhere and are afraid of everything . "
" well , and how is prince alexander to blame ?
he is a most <unk> man .
i used to meet him at mary ant'onovna 's , " said the countess in an offended tone ; and still more offended that they all remained silent , she went on : "
nowadays everyone finds fault .
a gospel society !
well , and what harm is there in that ? "
and she rose ( everybody else got up too ) and with a severe expression <unk> back to her table in the sitting room .
the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the children 's voices and laughter from the next room .
evidently some <unk> excitement was going on there .
" finished , finished ! "
little nat'asha 's gleeful yell rose above them all .
pierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas ( nat'asha he never lost sight of ) and smiled happily .
" that 's delightful music ! " said he .
" it means that anna <unk> has finished her stocking , " said countess mary .
" oh , i 'll go and see , " said pierre , jumping up .
" you know , " he added , stopping at the door , " why i 'm especially fond of that music ?
it is always the first thing that tells me all is well .
when i was driving here today , the nearer i got to the house the more anxious i grew .
as i entered the anteroom i heard andr'usha 's <unk> of laughter and that meant that all was well . "
" i know !
i know that feeling , " said nicholas .
" but i must n't go there - those stockings are to be a surprise for me . "
pierre went to the children , and the shouting and laughter grew still louder .
you stand here , and you in my arms - well now !
one , two !
... " said pierre , and a silence followed : " three ! " and a rapturously breathless cry of children 's voices filled the room . "
two , two !
" they shouted .
chapter xiv
soon after this the children came in to say good night .
they kissed everyone , the tutors and governesses made their bows , and they went out .
only young nicholas and his tutor remained .
dessalles whispered to the boy to come downstairs .
" no , monsieur dessalles , i will ask my aunt to let me stay , " replied nicholas bolk'onski also in a whisper .
" ma <unk> , please let me stay , " said he , going up to his aunt .
his face expressed entreaty , agitation , and ecstasy .
countess mary glanced at him and turned to pierre .
" when you are here he ca n't tear himself away , " she said .
" i will bring him to you directly , monsieur dessalles .
good night ! " said pierre , giving his hand to the swiss tutor , and he turned to young nicholas with a smile .
" you and i have n't seen anything of one another yet ....
how like he is growing , mary ! "
he added , addressing countess mary .
" like my father ? " asked the boy , flushing crimson and looking up at pierre with bright , ecstatic eyes .
pierre nodded , and went on with what he had been saying when the children had interrupted .
countess mary sat down doing <unk> ; nat'asha did not take her eyes off her husband .
nicholas and den'isov rose , asked for their pipes , <unk> , went to fetch more tea from s'onya - who sat weary but resolute at the samovar - and questioned pierre .
the conversation turned on the <unk> gossip about those in power , in which most people see the chief interest of home politics .
" one used to have to be a german - now one must dance with <unk> and madame <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and the <unk> .
oh , they should let that fine fellow bonaparte loose - <unk> knock all this nonsense out of them !
fancy giving the command of the sem"enov <unk> to a fellow like that <unk> !
" he cried .
and so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question pierre .
the questions put by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the higher government circles .
" what was it about ? " asked nicholas .
" always the same thing , " said pierre , looking round at his listeners .
" everybody sees that things are going so badly that they can not be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all <unk> men to <unk> it as far as they can . "
" what can <unk> men do ? "
nicholas inquired , frowning slightly . "
what can be done ? "
" why , this ... "
" come into my study , " said nicholas .
nat'asha , who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby , now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery .
countess mary followed her .
the men went into the study and little nicholas bolk'onski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a <unk> corner by the window .
" well , what would you do ? " asked den'isov .
" always some <unk> <unk> , " said nicholas .
he has abandoned himself altogether to this <unk> " ( pierre could not <unk> <unk> in anyone now ) . "
he seeks only for peace , and only these people <unk> foi <unk> <unk>
* can give it him - people who <unk> hack at and <unk> everything - magn'itski , arakch'eev , and <unk> <unk> ....
you will agree that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life , the <unk> your steward was the more readily your object might be attained , " he said to nicholas .
* without faith or law .
" well , what does that lead up to ? " said nicholas .
" well , everything is going to ruin !
robbery in the law <unk> , in the army nothing but flogging , <unk> , and military <unk> ; the people are tortured , enlightenment is suppressed .
all that is young and honest is crushed !
everyone sees that this can not go on .
everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break , " said pierre ( as those who examine the actions of any government have always said since <unk> began ) .
" i told them just one thing in petersburg . "
" told whom ? "
" well , you know whom , " said pierre , with a meaning glance from under his brows . "
prince theodore and all those .
to encourage <unk> and <unk> is all very well of course .
the aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something else is needed . "
at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew .
his face darkened and he went up to the boy .
" why are you here ? "
" why ?
let him be , " said pierre , taking nicholas by the arm and continuing .
" that is not enough , i told them .
something else is needed .
when you stand expecting the <unk> string to <unk> at any moment , when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe , as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to <unk> the general calamity .
everything that is young and strong is being <unk> away and depraved .
one is <unk> by women , another by honors , a third by ambition or money , and they go over to that camp .
no independent men , such as you or i , are left .
what i say is <unk> the <unk> of our society , let the mot <unk> be not virtue alone but independence and action as well ! "
nicholas , who had left his nephew , irritably pushed up an armchair , sat down in it , and listened to pierre , coughing <unk> and frowning more and more .
" but action with what aim ? " he cried . "
and what position will you adopt toward the government ? "
" why , the position of assistants .
the society need not be secret if the government <unk> it .
not merely is it not hostile to government , but it is a society of true <unk> - a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word .
it is only to prevent some <unk> or other from killing my children and yours , and arakch'eev from sending me off to some military <unk> .
we join hands only for the public welfare and the general <unk> . "
" yes , but it 's a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one which can only cause harm . "
" why ?
did the <unk> which saved europe " ( they did not then venture to suggest that russia had saved europe ) " do any harm ?
the <unk> is an alliance of virtue : it is love , <unk> help ...
it is what christ preached on the cross . "
nat'asha , who had come in during the conversation , looked joyfully at her husband .
the boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn - down collar - whom everyone had forgotten - gazed at pierre with even greater and more rapturous joy .
every word of pierre 's burned into his heart , and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill <unk> his hands came upon on his uncle 's table .
" it is not at all what you suppose ; but that is what the german <unk> was , and what i am proposing . "
" no , my fwiend !
the <unk> is all vewy well for the sausage <unk> , but i do n't understand it and ca n't even <unk> it
, " interposed den'isov in a loud and resolute voice .
" i <unk> that <unk> here is <unk> and <unk> , but the <unk> i do n't understand .
if we 're not satisfied , let us have a <unk> of our own .
that 's all wight .
je suis <unk> homme ! "
*
* " i 'm your man . "
pierre maintained the contrary , and as his mental faculties were greater and more <unk> , nicholas felt himself <unk> .
this made him still <unk> , for he was fully convinced , not by reasoning but by something within him stronger than reason , of the justice of his opinion .
" i will tell you this , " he said , rising and trying with nervously twitching fingers to <unk> up his pipe in a corner , but finally abandoning the attempt .
" i ca n't prove it to you .
you say that everything here is <unk> and that an overthrow is coming : i do n't see it .
i know it is my duty to obey the government .
and if arakch'eev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down , i should not <unk> an instant , but should do it . '
and you may argue about that as you like ! "
an awkward silence followed these words .
nat'asha was the first to speak , defending her husband and attacking her brother .
her defense was weak and <unk> but she attained her object .
the conversation was resumed , and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas ' last remark .
when they all got up to go in to supper , little nicholas bolk'onski went up to pierre , pale and with shining , radiant eyes .
" uncle pierre , you ...
no ...
if papa were alive ... would he agree with you ?
" he asked .
he had , however , to give him an answer .
" yes , i think so , " he said reluctantly , and left the study .
the lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he had done to the things on the table .
he flushed and went up to nicholas .
" uncle , forgive me , i did that ... <unk> , " he said , pointing to the broken sealing wax and <unk> .
nicholas started angrily .
" all right , all right , " he said , throwing the <unk> under the table .
and evidently <unk> his vexation with difficulty , he turned away from the boy .
" you ought not to have been here at all , " he said .
chapter xv
the conversation at supper was not about politics or <unk> , but turned on the subject nicholas liked best - recollections of 1812 .
den'isov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about them .
the family separated on the most friendly terms .
" what are you writing , mary ? " nicholas asked .
countess mary blushed .
she was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood or approved by her husband .
she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him , but at the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to tell him .
" a diary , nicholas , " she replied , handing him a blue exercise book filled with her firm , bold writing .
" a diary ? "
nicholas repeated with a shade of irony , and he took up the book .
it was in french .
december 4 .
today when andr'usha ( her eldest boy ) woke up he did not wish to dress and mademoiselle <unk> sent for me .
he was <unk> and <unk> .
i tried <unk> , but he only grew <unk> .
then i took the matter in hand : i left him alone and began with nurse 's help to get the other children up , telling him that i did not love him .
for a long time he was silent , as if astonished , then he jumped out of bed , ran to me in his shirt , and sobbed so that i could not calm him for a long time .
it was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me .
afterwards in the evening when i gave him his <unk> , he again began crying piteously and kissing me .
one can do anything with him by tenderness .
" what is a ' <unk> ' ? " nicholas inquired .
" i have begun giving the elder ones <unk> every evening , showing how they have behaved . "
nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him , and continued to turn over the pages and read .
in the diary was set down everything in the children 's lives that seemed <unk> to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational methods .
they were for the most part quite insignificant trifles , but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either , now that he read this diary about his children for the first time .
under the <unk> " 5 " was entered :
<unk> was <unk> at table .
papa said he was to have no pudding .
he had none , but looked so <unk> and greedily at the others while they were eating !
i think that <unk> by depriving children of sweets only <unk> their <unk> .
must tell nicholas this .
nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife .
the radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly : would he approve or <unk> of her diary ?
there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration for his wife .
perhaps it need not be done so <unk> , thought nicholas , or even done at all , but this <unk> , continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the children 's moral welfare delighted him .
" i quite , quite approve , my dearest ! " said he with a significant look , and after a short pause he added : " and i behaved badly today .
you were n't in the study .
we began disputing - pierre and i - and i lost my temper .
but he is impossible : such a child !
i do n't know what would become of him if nat'asha did n't keep him in hand ....
have you any idea why he went to petersburg ?
they have formed ... "
" yes , i know , " said countess mary .
" nat'asha told me . "
i am sorry you were n't there .
they all fell on me - den'isov and nat'asha
... nat'asha is absurd .
how she rules over him !
and yet there need only be a discussion
and she has no words of her own but only <unk> his sayings ... " added nicholas , yielding to that irresistible inclination which <unk> us to judge those nearest and dearest to us .
he forgot that what he was saying about nat'asha could have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife .
" yes , i have noticed that , " said countess mary .
" when i told him that duty and the <unk> were above everything , he started <unk> goodness knows what !
a pity you were not there - what would you have said ? "
" as i see it you were quite right , and i told nat'asha so .
pierre says everybody is suffering , tortured , and being <unk> , and that it is our duty to help our neighbor .
" yes , that 's it !
that 's just what i said to him , " put in nicholas , who fancied he really had said it . "
but they insisted on their own view : love of one 's neighbor and christianity - and all this in the presence of young nicholas , who had gone into my study and broke all my things . "
" ah , nicholas , do you know i am often troubled about little nicholas , " said countess mary .
" he is such an exceptional boy .
i am afraid i neglect him in favor of my own : we all have children and relations while he has no one .
he is constantly alone with his thoughts . "
" well , i do n't think you need reproach yourself on his account .
all that the <unk> mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for him , and of course i am glad of it .
he is a fine lad , a fine lad !
this evening he listened to pierre in a sort of <unk> , and fancy - as we were going in to supper
i looked and he had broken everything on my table to <unk> , and he told me of it himself at once !
i never knew him to tell an untruth .
a fine lad , a fine lad ! " repeated nicholas , who at heart was not fond of nicholas bolk'onski but was always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad .
" still , i am not the same as his own mother , " said countess mary .
" i feel i am not the same and it troubles me .
a wonderful boy , but i am dreadfully afraid for him .
it would be good for him to have companions . "
" well it wo n't be for long .
next summer i 'll take him to petersburg , " said nicholas .
" yes , pierre always was a <unk> and always will be , " he continued , returning to the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him . "
well , what business is it of mine what goes on there - whether arakch'eev is bad , and all that ?
what business was it of mine when i married and was so deep in debt that i was threatened with prison , and had a mother who could not see or understand it ?
and then there are you and the children and our affairs .
is it for my own pleasure that i am at the <unk> or in the office from morning to night ?
no ,
but i know i must work to comfort my mother , to repay you , and not to leave the children such <unk> as i was . "
countess mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone and that he attached too much importance to these matters .
but she knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so .
she only took his hand and kissed it .
he took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of his thoughts , and after a few minutes ' reflection continued to think aloud .
" you know , mary , today <unk> <unk> " ( this was his overseer ) " came back from the <unk> estate and told me they are already offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest . "
and with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility of <unk> otr'adnoe before long , and added : " another ten years of life and i shall leave the children ... in an excellent position . "
countess mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told her .
she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes ask her what he had been saying , and be vexed if he noticed that she had been thinking about something else .
but she had to force herself to attend , for what he was saying did not interest her at all .
she looked at him and did not think , but felt , about something different .
she felt a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all that she understood , and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness .
besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husband 's plans , thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind .
she thought of her nephew .
she did not <unk> them with him , but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him , and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young nicholas .
countess mary 's soul always <unk> toward the infinite , the eternal , and the absolute , and could therefore never be at peace .
a stern expression of the lofty , secret suffering of a soul <unk> by the body appeared on her face .
nicholas gazed at her . "
o god !
what will become of us if she <unk> , as i always fear when her face is like that ?
" thought he , and placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers .
chapter xvi
nat'asha was so used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the <unk> sign of something being wrong between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning .
when he began <unk> anything , or talking <unk> and calmly and she , led on by his example , began to do the same , she knew that they were on the <unk> of a quarrel .
you wo n't <unk> that moment this conversation began , contrary to all the laws of <unk> and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time .
this <unk> discussion of many <unk> did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the <unk> sign that they fully understood one another .
pierre , answering nat'asha 's words , told her how <unk> it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg .
" i have quite lost the <unk> of talking to ladies , " he said .
" it was simply dull .
besides , i was very busy . "
nat'asha looked intently at him and went on :
" mary is so splendid , " she said .
" how she understands children !
it is as if she saw straight into their souls .
yesterday , for instance , <unk> was <unk> ... "
" how like his father he is , " pierre <unk> .
nat'asha knew why he mentioned <unk> 's <unk> to nicholas : the recollection of his dispute with his brother - in - law was unpleasant and he wanted to know what nat'asha thought of it .
" nicholas has the weakness of never <unk> with anything not generally accepted .
but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line , " said she , repeating words pierre had once uttered .
" no , the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and <unk> are an amusement - almost a pastime , " said pierre .
" you know how much i ... " he began to <unk> down what he had said ; but nat'asha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary .
" so you say ideas are an amusement to him .... "
" yes , and for me nothing else is serious .
all the time in petersburg i saw everyone as in a dream .
when i am taken up by a thought , all else is mere amusement . "
" ah , i 'm so sorry i was n't there when you met the children , " said nat'asha .
" which was most delighted ?
<unk> , i 'm sure . "
" yes , " pierre replied , and went on with what was in his mind . "
nicholas says we ought not to think .
but i ca n't help it .
besides , when i was in petersburg i felt ( i can say this to you ) that the whole affair would go to pieces without me - everyone was pulling his own way .
but i succeeded in uniting them all ; and then my idea is so clear and simple .
you see , i do n't say that we ought to <unk> this and that .
we may be mistaken .
what i say is : ' join hands , you who love the right , and let there be but one <unk> - that of active virtue . '
prince serg'ey is a fine fellow and clever . "
nat'asha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierre 's idea , but one thing disconcerted her . "
can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband ?
how did this happen ?
" she wished to express this doubt to him . "
now who could decide whether he is really <unk> than all the others ?
" she asked herself , and passed in review all those whom pierre most respected .
judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as plat'on karat'aev .
" do you know what i am thinking about ? " she asked . "
about plat'on karat'aev .
would he have approved of you now , do you think ? "
pierre was not at all surprised at this question .
he understood his wife 's line of thought .
" plat'on karat'aev ? " he repeated , and pondered , evidently sincerely trying to imagine karat'aev 's opinion on the subject . "
he would not have understood ... yet perhaps he would . "
" i love you awfully ! " nat'asha suddenly said .
" awfully , awfully ! "
" no , he would not have approved , " said pierre , after reflection .
" what he would have approved of is our family life .
he was always so anxious to find <unk> , happiness , and peace in everything , and i should have been proud to let him see us .
there now - you talk of my absence , but you would n't believe what a special feeling i have for you after a separation .... "
" yes , i should think ... " nat'asha began .
" no , it 's not that .
i never leave off loving you .
and one could n't love more , but this is something special ....
yes , of <unk> " he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest .
" what nonsense it is , " nat'asha suddenly exclaimed , " about <unk> , and that the greatest happiness is at first !
on the contrary , now is the best of all .
if only you did not go away !
do you remember how we quarreled ?
and it was always my fault .
always mine .
and what we quarreled about - i do n't even remember ! "
" always about the same thing , " said pierre with a smile . "
<unk> ... "
" do n't say it !
i ca n't bear it ! "
nat'asha cried , and her eyes glittered coldly and <unk> . "
did you see her ?
" she added , after a pause .
" no , and if i had i should n't have recognized her . "
they were silent for a while .
" oh , do you know ?
while you were talking in the study i was looking at you , " nat'asha began , evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had come over them .
" you are as like him as two <unk> - like the boy . "
( she meant her little son . )
" oh , it 's time to go to him ....
the milk 's come ....
but i 'm sorry to leave you . "
they were silent for a few seconds .
then suddenly turning to one another at the same time they both began to speak .
pierre began with self - satisfaction and enthusiasm , nat'asha with a quiet , happy smile .
having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continue .
" no . what did you say ?
go on , go on . "
" no , you go on , i was talking nonsense , " said nat'asha .
pierre finished what he had begun .
it was the <unk> to his complacent reflections on his success in petersburg .
at that moment it seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of russian society and to the whole world .
" i only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always simple ones .
my whole idea is that if vicious people are united and <unk> a power , then honest folk must do the same .
now that 's simple enough . "
" yes . "
" and what were you going to say ? "
" i ?
only nonsense . "
" but all the same ? "
" oh nothing , only a <unk> , " said nat'asha , smiling still more brightly . "
i only wanted to tell you about p'etya : today nurse was coming to take him from me , and he laughed , shut his eyes , and clung to me .
i 'm sure he thought he was hiding .
awfully sweet !
there , now he 's crying .
well , good - by ! "
and she left the room .
meanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bolk'onski 's bedroom a little lamp was burning as usual .
( the boy was afraid of the dark and they could not cure him of it . )
dessalles slept <unk> up on four pillows and his roman nose <unk> sounds of rhythmic <unk> .
little nicholas , who had just <unk> up in a cold perspiration , sat up in bed and gazed before him with wide - open eyes .
he had <unk> from a terrible dream .
he had dreamed that he and uncle pierre , wearing <unk> such as were depicted in his <unk> , were leading a huge army .
the army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air like the <unk> that <unk> about in autumn and which dessalles called les <unk> de la <unk> .
in front was glory , which was similar to those <unk> but rather <unk> .
he and pierre were borne along lightly and joyously , nearer and nearer to their goal .
suddenly the <unk> that moved them began to <unk> and become entangled and it grew difficult to move .
and uncle nicholas stood before them in a stern and threatening attitude .
" have you done this ? "
he said , pointing to some broken sealing wax and <unk> .
" i loved you , but i have orders from arakch'eev and will kill the first of you who moves forward . "
little nicholas turned to look at pierre but pierre was no longer there .
his father <unk> and pitied him .
but uncle nicholas came nearer and nearer to them .
terror seized young nicholas and he awoke .
" my father ! " he thought .
( though there were two good <unk> of prince andrew in the house , nicholas never imagined him in human form . )
" my father has been with me and <unk> me .
he approved of me and of uncle pierre .
whatever he may tell me , i will do it .
<unk> <unk> burned his hand .
why should not the same sort of thing happen to me ?
i know they want me to learn .
and i will learn .
but someday i shall have finished learning , and then i will do something .
i only pray god that something may happen to me such as happened to <unk> 's men , and i will act as they did .
i will do better .
everyone shall know me , love me , and be delighted with me ! "
and suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry .
" are you ill ? "
he heard dessalles ' voice asking .
" no , " answered nicholas , and lay back on his pillow .
" he is good and kind and i am fond of him ! " he thought of dessalles . "
but uncle pierre !
oh , what a wonderful man he is !
and my father ?
oh , father , father !
yes , i will do something with which even he would be satisfied .... "
second <unk>
chapter i
history is the life of nations and of humanity .
to seize and put into words , to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single nation , appears impossible .
the ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe and seize the apparently <unk> - the life of a people .
they described the activity of <unk> who <unk> the people , and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation .
the question : how did <unk> make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these <unk> themselves guided ?
the ancients met by recognizing a <unk> which <unk> the nations to the will of a chosen man , and guided the will of that chosen man so as to <unk> ends that were predestined .
for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct <unk> of the <unk> in human affairs .
modern history , in theory , <unk> both these principles .
but modern history has not done this .
having in theory <unk> the view held by the ancients , it still follows them in practice .
at the basis of the <unk> of all the modern historians from <unk> to <unk> , despite their seeming <unk> and the apparent novelty of their <unk> , lie those two old , <unk> <unk> .
in <unk> a <unk> <unk> in paris ; it <unk> , <unk> , and is expressed by a movement of peoples from <unk> to east .
several times it moves <unk> and <unk> with a <unk> from the east <unk> .
the <unk> movement <unk> the starting point of the first movement in the <unk> - paris - and <unk> .
what does all this mean ?
why did it happen ?
what made those people burn houses and <unk> their fellow men ?
what were the causes of these events ?
what force made men act so ?
these are the instinctive , plain , and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of that period .
for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history , whose aim is to <unk> nations and humanity to know themselves .
one might believe or <unk> in the divine significance of napoleon , but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing <unk> in the history of that period , nor would there have been any <unk> .
but modern history can not give that reply .
science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct <unk> of the <unk> in human affairs , and therefore history ought to give other answers .
modern history replying to these questions says : you want to know what this movement means , what caused it , and what force produced these events ?
then listen :
" <unk> xiv was a very proud and self - confident man ; he had such and such <unk> and such and such ministers and he <unk> france badly .
his <unk> were weak men and they too <unk> france badly .
and they had such and such <unk> and such and such <unk> .
moreover , certain men wrote some books at that time .
at the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal .
this caused people all over france to begin to <unk> at and drown one another .
they killed the king and many other people .
at that time there was in france a man of genius - napoleon .
he <unk> everybody everywhere - that is , he killed many people because he was a great genius .
and for some reason he went to kill <unk> , and killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to france he ordered everybody to obey him , and they all obeyed him .
having become an emperor he again went out to kill people in <unk> , austria , and prussia .
and there too he killed a great many .
in russia there was an emperor , alexander , who decided to restore order in europe and therefore fought against napoleon .
in 1807 he suddenly made friends with him , but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people .
all napoleon 's allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised .
then <unk> xviii , who till then had been the <unk> both of the french and the allies , began to reign .
and napoleon , <unk> tears before his old guards , <unk> the throne and went into exile .
but the <unk> <unk> were angry at this and went to fight the french once more .
and they defeated the genius napoleon and , suddenly recognizing him as a <unk> , sent him to the island of st. <unk> .
and the exile , separated from the beloved france so dear to his heart , died a <unk> death on that <unk> and <unk> his great <unk> to posterity .
but in europe a <unk> occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to <unk> their subjects . "
it would be a mistake to think that this is ironic - a <unk> of the historical accounts .
the <unk> and <unk> of these replies <unk> from the fact that modern history , like a deaf man , answers questions no one has asked .
to this , modern history laboriously replies either that napoleon was a great genius , or that <unk> xiv was very proud , or that certain <unk> wrote certain books .
all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it , but it is not what was asked .
if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared , it should be explained in what this new force <unk> , for the whole interest of history lies <unk> in that force .
history seems to assume that this force is self - evident and known to everyone .
chapter ii
what force moves the nations ?
<unk> historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
in their <unk> events occur solely by the will of a napoleon , and alexander , or in general of the persons they describe .
the answers given by this kind of <unk> to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one <unk> to each event .
one <unk> says that an event was produced by napoleon 's power , another that it was produced by alexander 's , a third that it was due to the power of some other person .
besides this , historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based .
thiers , a <unk> , says that napoleon 's power was based on his virtue and genius .
<unk> , a <unk> , says it was based on his <unk> and deception of the people .
so the historians of this class , by <unk> destroying one another 's positions , destroy the understanding of the force which <unk> events , and <unk> no reply to history 's essential question .
<unk> of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the <unk> historians ' view of the force which <unk> events .
they do not recognize it as a power <unk> in <unk> and <unk> , but as the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> directed forces .
according to this view the power of historical personages , represented as the <unk> of many forces , can no longer , it would seem , be regarded as a force that itself <unk> events .
yet in most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself <unk> events , and treat it as their cause .
in their <unk> , an historic character is first the <unk> of his time , and his power only the <unk> of various forces , and then his power is itself a force <unk> events .
the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age produced napoleon 's power .
but napoleon 's power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age .
this curious contradiction is not <unk> .
not only does it occur at every step , but the universal historians ' accounts are all made up of a chain of such <unk> .
this contradiction occurs because after entering the field of <unk> the universal historians stop halfway .
to find <unk> forces equal to the <unk> or <unk> force , the sum of the <unk> must equal the <unk> .
this condition is never observed by the universal historians , and so to explain the <unk> forces they are obliged to admit , in addition to the insufficient <unk> , another <unk> force <unk> the <unk> action .
<unk> historians describing the campaign of <unk> or the <unk> of the bourbons plainly <unk> that these events were produced by the will of alexander .
that <unk> , madame de <unk> , and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their <unk> relations but does not account for the submission of millions .
and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted - that is , how <unk> forces equal to one a gave a <unk> equal to a thousand times a -
and that is just what the universal historians do , and consequently they not only contradict the <unk> historians but contradict themselves .
they see it in what is called <unk> - in mental activity .
of the immense number of <unk> accompanying every vital phenomenon , these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause .
but why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of <unk> to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand .
chapter iii
a <unk> is moving .
someone asks : " what moves it ? "
a peasant says the devil moves it .
another man says the <unk> moves because its wheels go round .
a third <unk> that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away .
the peasant is <unk> .
he has devised a complete explanation .
to <unk> him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil , or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a german , who moves the <unk> .
only then , as a result of the contradiction , will they see that they are both wrong .
the only conception that can explain the movement of the <unk> is that of a force <unk> with the movement observed .
the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force <unk> with the whole movement of the peoples .
yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds , all of which are <unk> with the movement observed .
and the only such conception known to historians is that of power .
in dealing with humanity 's inquiry , the science of history up to now is like money in <unk> - paper money and coin .
the <unk> and special <unk> <unk> are like paper money .
they can be used and can <unk> and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even <unk> , as long as no one asks what is the <unk> behind them .
you need only forget to ask how the will of <unk> <unk> events , and such <unk> as thiers ' will be interesting and <unk> and may perhaps even possess a <unk> of poetry .
that is , wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual <unk> .
it may indeed make jingling coin , but will do no more than that .
paper money may deceive the <unk> , but nobody is deceived by <unk> of base metal that have no value but merely <unk> .
as gold is gold only if it is <unk> not merely for exchange but also for use , so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to history 's essential question : what is power ?
the universal historians give contradictory replies to that question , while the historians of <unk> <unk> it and answer something quite different .
chapter iv
a return to the first is impossible , the belief has been destroyed ; and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power .
napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war .
we are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it
that the question : why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered certain words , seems to us senseless .
he had the power and so what he ordered was done .
this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by god .
but as soon as we do not admit that , it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others .
and that is how power is understood by the science of <unk> , that exchange bank of history which <unk> to exchange history 's understanding of power for true gold .
power is the <unk> will of the people transferred , by expressed or <unk> consent , to their chosen <unk> .
the science of <unk> regards the state and power as the ancients regarded fire - namely , as something <unk> absolutely .
but for history , the state and power are merely <unk> , just as for modern <unk> fire is not an <unk> but a phenomenon .
if power be the <unk> will of the people transferred to their ruler , was <unk> a representative of the will of the people ?
if not , then why was napoleon i ?
why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was taken prisoner at boulogne , and why , later on , were those criminals whom he arrested ?
do palace <unk> - in which sometimes only two or three people take part - transfer the will of the people to a new ruler ?
in <unk> relations , is the will of the people also transferred to their <unk> ?
was the will of the <unk> of the <unk> transferred to napoleon in 1806 ?
was the will of the russian people transferred to napoleon in 1809 , when our army in alliance with the french went to fight the austrians ?
to these questions three answers are possible :
and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their <unk> .
evidently the explanations <unk> by these historians being <unk> contradictory can only satisfy young children .
but what this program <unk> in these historians do not say , or if they do they continually contradict one another .
each <unk> , according to his view of what <unk> a nation 's progress , looks for these conditions in the greatness , wealth , freedom , or enlightenment of <unk> of france or some other country .
but not to mention the historians ' <unk> as to the nature of this program - or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists - the facts of history almost always contradict that theory .
to this question historians reply that <unk> xiv 's activity , contrary to the program , <unk> on <unk> xvi .
but why did it not <unk> on <unk> xiv or on <unk> xv - why should it <unk> just on <unk> xvi ?
and what is the time limit for such <unk> ?
to these questions there are and can be no answers .
and so these historians also see and admit historical events which are <unk> to the theory .
historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages <unk> , but that the conditions are unknown to us .
they say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been <unk> to them .
but in that case , if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves , what significance have those leaders ?
the leaders , these historians tell us , express the will of the people : the activity of the leaders <unk> the activity of the people .
but in that case the question <unk> whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the people 's will or only some part of it .
met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure , <unk> , and general <unk> which can cover all <unk> occurrences , and declare this <unk> to be the aim of humanity 's movement .
the most usual <unk> adopted by almost all the historians are : freedom , equality , enlightenment , progress , <unk> , and <unk> .
history <unk> this at every turn .
is the movement of the russian people <unk> to kaz'an and siberia expressed by details of the <unk> character of iv'an the terrible and by his correspondence with <unk> ?
is the movement of the peoples at the time of the <unk> explained by the life and activity of the <unk> and the <unk> - <unk> and their ladies ?
for us that movement of the peoples from <unk> to east , without leaders , with a crowd of <unk> , and with peter the <unk> , remains incomprehensible .
and yet more incomprehensible is the <unk> of that movement when a <unk> and sacred aim for the <unk> - the deliverance of <unk> - had been clearly defined by historic leaders .
<unk> , kings , and knights <unk> the peoples to free the holy land ; but the people did not go , for the unknown cause which had previously <unk> them to go no longer existed .
the history of the <unk> and the <unk> can evidently not cover the life of the peoples .
and the history of the <unk> and the <unk> has remained the history of <unk> and <unk> , but the history of the life of the peoples and their <unk> has remained unknown .
still less does the history of <unk> and <unk> explain to us the life of the peoples .
the history of <unk> explains to us the <unk> and conditions of life and thought of a <unk> or a <unk> .
if we unite both these kinds of history , as is done by the <unk> historians , we shall have the history of <unk> and <unk> , but not the history of the life of the peoples .
chapter v
the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men , for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found .
the theory that this connection is based on the <unk> of the <unk> will of a people to certain historical personages is an <unk> <unk> by the experience of history .
the theory seems <unk> just because the act of <unk> of the people 's will can not be <unk> , for it never occurred .
whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs , the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the <unk> will was transferred to him .
" the <unk> goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the <unk> will of all the other animals is <unk> in that leader . "
this is what historians of the first class say - those who assume the <unk> <unk> of the people 's will .
so say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons , from <unk> to <unk> , as the expression of their age .
the theory of the <unk> of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a <unk> - a <unk> of the question in other words .
what causes historical events ?
power .
what is power ?
power is the <unk> will of the people transferred to one person .
under what condition is the will of the people <unk> to one person ?
on condition that that person <unk> the will of the whole people .
that is , power is power : in other words , power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand .
but to understand <unk> man has , besides <unk> reasoning , experience by which he <unk> his reflections .
and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually <unk> phenomenon .
not to speak of the fact that no description of the <unk> activity of men can do without the conception of power , the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing <unk> events .
whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear , by whose will the event seems to have taken place .
napoleon iii <unk> a <unk> and the french go to <unk> .
the king of prussia and <unk> issue <unk> and an army enters <unk> .
napoleon i <unk> a <unk> and an army enters russia .
alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the bourbons .
experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have <unk> it .
without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we can not regard " power " as the cause of events .
power , from the <unk> of experience , is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someone 's will and the execution of that will by others .
to explain the conditions of that <unk> we must first establish a conception of the expression of will , referring it to man and not to the <unk> .
chapter vi
<unk> the first condition omitted , that of time , we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given <unk> the execution of the last command possible .
when , for instance , we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war , we combine in one <unk> expression a whole series of <unk> commands <unk> one on another .
napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of russia and never did so .
for an order to be certainly executed , it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed .
every order executed is always one of an immense number <unk> .
all the impossible orders <unk> with the course of events remain <unk> .
only the possible ones get <unk> up with a <unk> series of commands <unk> to a series of events , and are executed .
we say that napoleon wished to <unk> russia and <unk> it .
in reality in all napoleon 's activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish , but find a series of orders , or expressions of his will , very <unk> and <unk> directed .
so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events , we find that a command can never be the cause of the event , but that a certain definite <unk> exists between the two .
this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power .
this relation <unk> in the following :
for common action people always unite in certain <unk> , in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action , the relation between those taking part in it is always the same .
of all the <unk> in which men unite for <unk> action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army .
the soldiers , of whom there are the most , form the lower section of the <unk> and its base .
the soldier himself does the <unk> , <unk> , burning , and <unk> , and always receives orders for these actions from men above him ; he himself never gives an order .
the noncommissioned officers ( of whom there are <unk> ) perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers , but they already give commands .
an officer still less often acts directly himself , but commands still more frequently .
a general does nothing but command the troops , <unk> the <unk> , and hardly ever <unk> a weapon himself .
the commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself , but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops .
a similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity - in <unk> , <unk> , and every <unk> .
this relation of the men who command to those they command is what <unk> the essence of the conception called power .
having restored the condition of time under which all events occur , we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a <unk> series of events .
chapter vii
when one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled , that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it .
men are <unk> a log .
each of them <unk> his opinion as to how and where to <unk> it .
they <unk> the log away , and it happens that this is done as one of them said .
he ordered it .
there we have command and power in their <unk> form .
when a man <unk> alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity , justify his present activity , and guide him in planning his future actions .
just the same is done by a <unk> of people , <unk> those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations , <unk> , and <unk> concerning their <unk> activity .
for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill one another .
and <unk> to the event its justification appears in people 's belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france , for liberty , and for equality .
people ceased to kill one another , and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a <unk> of power , <unk> to europe , and so on .
men went from the <unk> to the east killing their fellow men , and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of france , the baseness of england , and so on .
but these <unk> have a very necessary significance in their own day .
these <unk> release those who produce the events from moral responsibility .
these <unk> aims are like the <unk> fixed in front of a <unk> to clear the snow from the rails in front : they clear men 's moral <unk> from their path .
without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that <unk> itself when examining each historical event .
how is it that millions of men commit <unk> <unk> - make war , commit murder , and so on ?
with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe can any event that is not <unk> , <unk> , or ordered by <unk> , ministers , <unk> , or <unk> be imagined ?
is there any <unk> action which can not find its justification in political unity , in patriotism , in the balance of power , or in <unk> ?
so that every event that occurs inevitably <unk> with some expressed wish and , receiving a justification , <unk> itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men .
in whatever direction a ship moves , the flow of the waves it <unk> will always be noticeable ahead of it .
to those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion .
when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it , when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently .
but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave <unk> its movement .
whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and <unk> .
examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which , as commands , were related to events , historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands .
but examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people , we have found that they and their orders were <unk> on events .
arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history :
( 1 ) what is power ?
( 2 ) what force <unk> the movement of the nations ?
morally the <unk> of power appears to cause the event ; physically it is those who submit to the power .
but as the moral activity is <unk> without the physical , the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the <unk> of the two .
or in other words , the conception of a cause is <unk> to the <unk> we are examining .
in the last <unk> we reach the circle of <unk> - that final limit to which in every <unk> of thought man 's reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject .
<unk> <unk> heat , heat <unk> <unk> .
<unk> attract each other and <unk> repel one another .
the same <unk> to historical events .
why war and revolution occur we do not know .
chapter viii
if history dealt only with external <unk> , the establishment of this simple and obvious law would <unk> and we should have finished our argument .
but the law of history <unk> to man .
the presence of the problem of man 's free will , though <unk> , is felt at every step of history .
all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question .
all the <unk> and <unk> of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question .
if the will of every man were free , that is , if each man could act as he pleased , all history would be a series of disconnected <unk> .
if there be a single law <unk> the actions of men , free will can not exist , for then man 's will is subject to that law .
in this contradiction lies the problem of free will , which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance .
but regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of , we feel ourselves to be free .
this consciousness is a source of self - <unk> quite apart from and independent of reason .
through his reason man <unk> himself , but only through consciousness does he know himself .
apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is <unk> .
to understand , observe , and draw <unk> , man must first of all be conscious of himself as living .
a man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills , that is , is conscious of his <unk> .
but his will - which forms the essence of his life - man recognizes ( and can but recognize ) as free .
if , observing himself , man sees that his will is always directed by one and the same law ( whether he <unk> the necessity of taking food , using his brain , or anything else )
he can not recognize this never - <unk> direction of his will otherwise than as a <unk> of it .
were it not free it could not be limited .
a man 's will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free .
you say : i am not free .
but i have lifted my hand and let it fall .
everyone understands that this <unk> reply is an <unk> <unk> of freedom .
that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason .
if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of self - consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience , but in fact such <unk> does not exist and is <unk> .
having learned from <unk> and argument that a stone falls downwards , a man <unk> <unk> this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled .
but learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws , he does not and can not believe this .
he could not live , because all man 's efforts , all his <unk> to life , are only efforts to increase freedom .
a man having no freedom can not be <unk> of except as deprived of life .
man is the creation of an all - powerful , all - good , and all - seeing god .
what is sin , the conception of which <unk> from the consciousness of man 's freedom ?
that is a question for <unk> .
the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in <unk> .
what is man 's responsibility to society , the conception of which results from the conception of freedom ?
that is a question for <unk> .
man 's actions proceed from his <unk> character and the <unk> acting upon him .
what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom ?
that is a question for <unk> .
man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life .
but the same man apart from that connection appears to be free .
how should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded - as the result of the free , or as the result of the constrained , activity of man ?
that is a question for history .
they do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the <unk> of one side of it .
chapter ix
in regard to this question , history stands to the other sciences as <unk> science stands to <unk> science .
the subject for history is not man 's will itself but our <unk> of it .
and so for history , the insoluble mystery presented by the <unk> of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for <unk> , <unk> , and philosophy .
history <unk> a <unk> of man 's life in which the <unk> of these two <unk> has already taken place .
in actual life each historic event , each human action , is very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction , although each event <unk> itself as partly free and partly compulsory .
to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are <unk> and what <unk> the essence of these two <unk> , the philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other sciences .
whatever <unk> of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider , we always regard it as the result partly of man 's free will and partly of the law of inevitability .
the degree of freedom and inevitability <unk> the actions of these people is clearly defined for us .
our conception of the degree of freedom often <unk> according to <unk> in the point of view from which we regard the event , but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability .
in every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability .
and always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we <unk> , and the more inevitability the less freedom .
the <unk> of freedom to inevitability <unk> and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded , but their relation is always one of <unk> <unk> .
in all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of <unk> is <unk> <unk> or increased , according to the point of view from which the action is regarded .
so that the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice <unk> .
religion , the common sense of mankind , the science of <unk> , and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom .
all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations :
( 1 ) the relation to the external world of the man who <unk> the <unk> .
( 2 ) his relation to time .
( 3 ) his relation to the causes leading to the action .
if we consider a man alone , apart from his relation to everything around him , each action of his seems to us free .
and the more we <unk> of these influences the more our conception of his freedom <unk> and the more our conception of the necessity that <unk> on him increases .
the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the man 's action <unk> in time .
that is the ground which makes the fall of the first man , resulting in the <unk> of the human race , appear evidently less free than a man 's entry into marriage today .
the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser <unk> of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it .
if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in <unk> the same circumstances as those i am in now , my action appears to me undoubtedly free .
if i reflect on an action still more remote , ten years ago or more , then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me
and i find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed .
the farther i go back in memory , or what is the same thing the farther
i go forward in my judgment , the more <unk> becomes my belief in the freedom of my action .
in history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity .
a <unk> event seems to us to be <unk> the doing of all the known <unk> , but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible .
and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear .
the <unk> - prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the <unk> conduct of <unk> , and so on .
the napoleonic wars still seem to us , though already <unk> , to be the <unk> of their <unk> ' will .
in regard to the <unk> of the peoples it does not enter anyone 's head today to suppose that the <unk> of the european world depended on <unk> 's caprice .
the farther back in history the object of our observation lies , the more <unk> does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability .
when we do not at all understand the cause of an action , whether a crime , a good action , or even one that is simply <unk> , we <unk> a greater <unk> of freedom to it .
in the case of a crime we most <unk> demand the <unk> for such an act ; in the case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly .
in an indifferent case we recognize in it more <unk> , <unk> , and independence .
that a criminal was reared among <unk> <unk> his fault in our eyes .
the <unk> of a <unk> or party , or an <unk> , <unk> us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity .
if we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation , our conception of their inevitability would be still greater .
the cause <unk> the action we can <unk> the result .
on these three considerations alone is based the conception of <unk> for <unk> and the <unk> circumstances admitted by all <unk> <unk> .
chapter x
may be - can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity .
( 1 ) to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be <unk> from the influence of the external world , we never get a conception of freedom in space .
every human action is inevitably <unk> by what <unk> him and by his own body .
i lift my arm and let it fall .
i chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were <unk> <unk> .
for my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no <unk> .
to conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space , which is evidently impossible .
( 2 ) however much we <unk> the time of judgment to the time of the deed , we never get a conception of freedom in time .
for if i examine an action committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not being free , for it is <unk> <unk> to the moment at which it was committed .
can i lift my arm ?
i lift it , but ask myself : could i have <unk> from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed ?
to convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment .
but i am not now <unk> from doing so at the first moment when i asked the question .
time has gone by which i could not detain , the arm i then lifted is no longer the same as the arm
i now refrain from lifting , nor is the air in which i lifted it the same that now <unk> me .
the moment in which the first movement was made is <unk> , and at that moment i could make only one movement , and whatever movement i made would be the only one .
that i did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that i could have <unk> from lifting it then .
and since i could make only one movement at that single moment of time , it could not have been any other .
to imagine it as free , it is necessary to imagine it in the present , on the boundary between the past and the future - that is , outside time , which is impossible .
( 3 ) however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased , we never reach a conception of complete freedom , that is , an absence of cause .
i raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause , but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action .
in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite <unk> of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability .
( 1 )
however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated , that knowledge can never be complete , for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the <unk> of space .
and therefore so long as not all the conditions <unk> men are defined , there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains .
( 2 )
( 3 ) however <unk> may be the chain of <unk> of any action , we shall never know the whole chain since it is <unk> , and so again we never reach absolute inevitability .
and so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any <unk> of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a man 's completely free action .
to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability , we must imagine him all alone , beyond space , beyond time , and free from <unk> on cause .
in the first case , if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a <unk> of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself , that is , a mere form without content .
we should in fact have reached those two <unk> of which man 's whole <unk> on the universe is constructed - the incomprehensible essence of life , and the laws <unk> that essence .
reason says : ( 1 ) space with all the forms of matter that give it <unk> is infinite , and can not be imagined otherwise .
( 2 ) time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise .
( 3 )
the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end .
consciousness says : ( 1 ) i alone am , and all that exists is but me , consequently i <unk> space .
( 2 ) i measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as living , consequently i am outside time .
( 3 ) i am beyond cause , for i feel myself to be the cause of every <unk> of my life .
reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability .
consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom .
freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life , in man 's consciousness .
inevitability without content is man 's reason in its three forms .
freedom is the thing examined .
inevitability is what <unk> .
freedom is the content .
inevitability is the form .
only by separating the two sources of <unk> , related to one another as form to content , do we get the <unk> <unk> and separately incomprehensible <unk> of freedom and inevitability .
only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man 's life .
apart from these two <unk> which in their <unk> <unk> <unk> one another as form and content , no conception of life is possible .
all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability , that is , of consciousness to the laws of reason .
all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability , or of the essence of life to the laws of reason .
all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason .
man 's free will <unk> from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it , but in the eyes of reason it in no way <unk> from any other force .
the forces of <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> <unk> are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason .
just so the force of man 's free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the <unk> reason gives it .
in the <unk> sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability , what is unknown to us we call vital force .
vital force is only an expression for the unknown <unk> over and above what we know of the essence of life .
so also in history what is known to us
we call laws of inevitability ,
what is unknown we call free will .
free will is for history only an expression for the unknown <unk> of what we know about the laws of human life .
chapter xi
that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws , that is , of any science whatever .
if there is even a single body moving freely , then the laws of <unk> and <unk> are <unk> and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists .
if any single action is due to free will , then not a single historical law can exist , nor any conception of historical events .
the more this field of motion <unk> out before our eyes , the more evident are the laws of that movement .
to discover and <unk> those laws is the problem of history .
all human sciences have traveled along that path .
arriving at <unk> , mathematics , the most exact of sciences , <unk> the process of <unk> and enters on the new process of the <unk> of unknown , infinitely small , <unk> .
abandoning the conception of cause , mathematics seeks law , that is , the property common to all unknown , infinitely small , elements .
in another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded .
the same is done by the natural sciences : leaving aside the question of cause , they seek for laws .
history stands on the same path .
chapter xii
from the time the law of <unk> was discovered and proved , the mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves <unk> to destroy the whole <unk> of the ancients .
by <unk> that law it might have been possible to <unk> the old conception of the movements of the bodies , but without <unk> it , it would seem impossible to continue <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
but even after the discovery of the law of <unk> the <unk> <unk> were still studied for a long time .
by <unk> these new laws the former view of history might have been retained ; but without <unk> them it would seem impossible to continue <unk> historic events as the results of man 's free will .
and yet the former history <unk> to be studied side by side with the laws of <unk> , <unk> , political <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , which directly contradict its <unk> .
the struggle between the old views and the new was long and <unk> fought out in physical philosophy .
<unk> stood on guard for the old views and accused the new of <unk> <unk> .
but when truth <unk> , <unk> established itself just as firmly on the new <unk> .
in the one case as in the other , on both sides the struggle <unk> passion and <unk> truth .
on the one hand there is fear and regret for the loss of the whole <unk> constructed through the ages , on the other is the passion for destruction .
to the <unk> of the laws of <unk> and <unk> , to <unk> for example , it seemed that the laws of <unk> destroyed religion , and he <unk> the law of <unk> as a weapon against religion .
as in the question of <unk> then , so in the question of history now , the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or <unk> of something absolute , serving as the measure of visible <unk> .
in <unk> it was the <unk> of the earth , in history it is the independence of personality - free will .
